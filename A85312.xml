            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>EIther we have dealt hypocritically with God and man, or elſe the Diviſions in theſe poore Churches have lain upon the hearts of the godly in <hi>England</hi> as an afflicting evil. The Civil Power have ſeemed to be ſo ſenſible of this evil, that more then once it hath been numbred amongst the cauſes in their Orders for our Solemn and Publike Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; if our Faſt-days, Prayers, Sermons, Books, &amp;c. may be believed, then the breaches in our Churches have broken our comforts. For my part I have cauſe to take ſhame, and to ask pardon of God that this ſin which hath wrought ſo much evil, and brought ſuch diſhonour to Chriſt, have no more affected me; it is for them whoſe hearts are moſt divided from ſelf, and united to God, to be <hi>indeed</hi> affected and afflicted with Diviſions in the Church. I look on it as an act of a grown Chriſtian, whoſe Intereſt in Chriſt is well cleared, and his heart walking cloſe with God, to be really taken up with the publike Intereſt of Chriſt. I will not meaſure other mens hearts by my own, but I muſt ſay for my ſelf, the good Lord pardon my hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie in this point, for to be affected as become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians for Diviſions among Chriſtians, I find it a hard matter, whatever words ſeem to affirm.</p>
            <p>Could I joy in my ſelf, I ſhould be glad that I lived to ſee the day when the Lord put it into two or three of your hearts to try what might be done for the healing
<pb facs="tcp:170413:3"/>of our breaches, and thereupon to call ſome of your Brethren together to ſee if we could agree ſo far that we might Aſſociate together, as ſome of our Brethren in other Countries have done: and let me leave this upon record, ſo long as this poor Script ſhall laſt, for the honour of the <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Brethren, as they were the firſt movers for peace, ſo they have bidden fair for peace; had our Congregational Brethren [whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, gifts, and graces I deſire to honour and love] been but anſwerable, we might have had cauſe to have joyned together in praiſes for our healing, as we have had, and ſtill have cauſe to mourn for our breaches.</p>
            <p>It is not to be forgotten how the good hand of God went along with us; for though we were men of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent principles who were choſen to draw up the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and we met neer twenty times before we could finiſh, yet no unbrotherly claſhing was heard amongst us; but ſo ſoon as we ſaw each others principles to be fixed, preſently we were called off from Diſputing, and the next words were, <hi>Come, let us ſee how we can Accommodate;</hi> let the bleſſing of <hi>Matth. 5.9.</hi> fall upon ſuch hearts.</p>
            <p>Were it true <hi>that uniting with our Brethren in this Aſſociation, were a dividing of our hearts from God,</hi> as one of our Congregational Brethren did intimate in a Sermon of his upon <hi>Hoſ. 10.2.</hi> then I wonder not though he ſo ſoon deſerted us, and that others ſtand off from us. For this he ſaid was one note of the heart di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from God, <hi>when the heart did not fully come up to God:</hi> and under this head brought in ſuch <hi>who did faſhion and mould themſelves in State and Church according to the Mode of the Times, though contrary to their own principles and light, croſs to [or laying by] the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, when as
<pb facs="tcp:170413:3"/>the Text ſaith,</hi> Jer. <hi>15.19. If thou ſeparate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious from the vile, &amp;c.</hi> our Brothers aim was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by divers in the Congregation, and unto him I ſhall return this anſwer.</p>
            <p>If he means I have gone contrary to my own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and light, he is miſtaken extreamly. If he meant he and other Congregational men muſt do ſo if they Aſſociate, how can this poſſibly be, when it was one of our foundations we laid for agreement, and it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed again and again, <hi>that we went not about to take any man off from his Principles?</hi> I wiſh our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had inſtanced what Inſtitution of Chriſt we croſſed or laid by.</p>
            <p>For the Scripture he alledged, let us ſee how this ſuits our caſe; the Presbyterial Brethren do not indeed ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as do he and others, but doth he therefore upon this Text ſtand off? I finde five ſeveral expoſitions of the words, and very few who take the word <hi>Precious</hi> for to relate to <hi>Perſons.</hi> But I will give my Brother that ſenſe, Let it be meant of Perſons,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> word which the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus Golius</hi> renders <hi>generoſus, nobilis.</hi> And the other <hi>(Dalilon) abjectus, vllis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptus.</hi>
               </note> as <hi>Piſcator</hi> thinks it moſt proper, becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>alibi de perſona tantùm dicitur.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Interlineary gloſs.</hi> Now the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, <hi>1.</hi> Who are meant by <hi>Precious? 2.</hi> How <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> was to ſeparate theſe Precious from the Vile.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, thoſe who do Interpret it of <hi>Perſons</hi> do all underſtand <hi>real Saints;</hi> and here ſtanding ſo in oppoſition to others it muſt needs be meant ſo. Obj. <hi>If he will ſay, that doth not follow; for all Iſrael were called</hi> holy, <hi>and that in as high a word as</hi> precious. I anſwer, The Lord ſpeaks of theſe who were called <hi>holy,</hi> and yet here commands the ſeparation of the <hi>Precious</hi> from the <hi>Vile;</hi> therefore it muſt be meant of <hi>real Saints.</hi> I could ſay more but ſpare.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> For the ſecond, How did he ſeparate, either by
<pb facs="tcp:170413:4"/>
               <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> Not by <hi>Diſcipline</hi> [which muſt ſerve my Brothers purpoſe.] For</p>
            <p>Firſt, To ſeparate <hi>real Saints</hi> from <hi>vile</hi> by <hi>Diſcipline</hi> is a hard work indeed, and ſuch a task as the Lord never put his Miniſters to; who knew mens hearts? then the Congregational Brethren muſt look to it that all their members are <hi>real Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> But if my Brother ſaith, by <hi>precious</hi> real Saints are not meant but <hi>viſible,</hi> though not ſo <hi>really.</hi> [Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that all were called <hi>holy.</hi>] This my Brother muſt prove, and then tell us what he means by a viſible Saint. But however ſeparation by <hi>Diſcipline</hi> cannot be meant. For</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. Jeremiah</hi> then had a ſtrange task, for he had no particular Church as we; and for him to ſeparate all viſible Saints from the vile in the Jewiſh Church by Diſcipline were a ſtrange and impoſſible work.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3. Jeremiah</hi> a ſingle Prieſt could not do it; as all that know the Jewiſh governments will confeſs.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> But put caſe it were ſo, yet this hinders not his Aſſociating with our Brethren, who deſire him but to Aſſociate, where they do ſeparate the precious from the vile by Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Since then this ſeparation was <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> as all Divines upon the Text acknowledge, then whether the <hi>Prebyterial</hi> Brethren [very many of them at leaſt] do not ſeparate as well as himſelf, I deſire my Brother to conſider. For the laſt words which he alſo uſed, <hi>Let them return to thee, but return not thou unto them.</hi> Doth my Brother indeed <hi>parallel</hi> our Aſſociated Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren with thoſe who are meant by <hi>them?</hi> Let the <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Brethren return to the <hi>Congregational,</hi> not they to them: I ſhould not have dared to have made ſuch a parallel.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170413:4"/>
            <p>I ſhall only put this Brother in mind what he then ſaid againſt thoſe <hi>who dare depart from</hi> ſtanding <hi>Commandments,</hi> and deſire him to conſider whether he never read of a <hi>ſtanding</hi> (to uſe his own words). Commandment, repeated again and again, <hi>that we ſhould follow the things which make for peace,</hi> and whether he, with our Brethren who ſtand off, have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that Commandment, ſober Congregational men ſhall judge.</p>
            <p>Let me leave with our Brethren a few lines which I received a few weaks ſince from that learned and godly Divine Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> [Teacher of the Church in <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>N. England</hi>] in a Letter to me. <hi>The Aſſociation you mention amongſt the Miniſters we much rejoyce in, I never thought it better then human, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times worſe, that the Presbyterian and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational men cannot cloſe together in Brotherly Communion. The power of godlineſs intereſt us in the affections of the godly, above the notions of either of them conſidered apart therefrom. I believe the Congregational way to be the truth: yet I think better of many Presbyterians then of many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational men. 'Tis no wonder if Independents are unruly, for I diſtinguiſh between Independents and Congregational men; or rather ſuch [call themſelves as they pleaſe] that will not acknowledge the rule of the Presbytery, and the order of Councils</hi> Thus far this reverend and great Divine. I am ſure our Aſſociation reaches no higher then a Council.</p>
            <p>As for our Brethren who will not Aſſociate till they ſee the Civil Magiſtrate ſet his ſtamp of Authority upon this way of Aſſociation, whatever the late <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> made by the Parliament allows us, though they ſee <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and Congregational Churches, and

            <p>To return to you then <hi>[Fathers and Brethren]</hi> in a few words. Hitherto God hath brought us; the worke we have engaged in is to <hi>moſt</hi> [if not <hi>all</hi> of us] <hi>new,</hi> and ſuch a work as many of thoſe who have been exerciſed in it, have ſo often miſcarried in, that the Ordinance of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> hath ſuffered much diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: and that which adds to the difficulty, we ſet to it in ſuch times wherein the Miniſtry is ſo much reviled by Sectaries, and as to this work much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned by the Gentry, and our Epiſcopal Divines; one of which <hi>[and whom I honour]</hi> ſaid to me, <hi>That we were no more fit to manage the government of the Church of</hi> England <hi>then</hi> David Saul<hi>'s Armour.</hi> We boaſt not of our fitneſs, but for the government of the Church by ſuch Biſhops [though I highly reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſome of them] they have no ſuch cauſe to boaſt, as witneſs the Churches they have left us miſerably overgrown with ignorance and profanneſs; had we ſo many hundreds [or thouſands] of pounds <hi>per annum,</hi>

            <p>But we muſt go to our work without <hi>Saul</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Everal definitions of <hi>Schiſm</hi> both ancient and modern the Doctor recites, none of which give him content. <hi>Auſtin</hi> [he ſaith] ſuited his definition directly to the cauſe he had in hand againſt the <hi>Donatiſts:</hi> for the reſt they do not ſatisfie him; then offers <hi>his</hi> definition, being <hi>the</hi> definition which agrees with Scripture, to which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, and eſteems this appeal to be <hi>neceſſary and reaſonable.</hi> I am of the Doctor's mind, and wiſh we had kept there all this time; for while ſome men made <hi>Providence</hi> their <hi>Bible,</hi> others make <hi>Antiquity</hi> theirs, they have made us by woful experience know the evil effects of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſuch <hi>Canons.</hi> Providences &amp; antiquity are excellent things to confirm us when they have clear Scriptures ſtand before them as Figures before Cyphers; and if men would redu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170413:7"/>actions and diſputes to this Head, by which one day we ſhal be judged, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. [and not by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences or Antiquity] as we might have ſpared many of our troubles, ſo we might ſooner come to the cloſing up of our breaches, which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is one part of the Doctors aim, but I can hardly believe will ever effect the Cure: For ſuppoſe he can convince men that this ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>from</hi> Churches is not Schiſm in the <hi>preciſe notion</hi> [as he often mentions] of Scripture; yet if they apprehend it to be ſomething elſe as <hi>bad,</hi> and it may be <hi>worſe,</hi> his book will prove ineffectual to the healing of our wounds.</p>
               <p>Thus then he defines Schiſin, <hi>p.</hi> 51, 52. <hi>It is a cauſeleſſe difference or diviſion amongſt the members of any particular Church that meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or ought ſo to do, for the worſhip of God and celebration of the ſame numerical ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the diſturbance of the order appointed by Jeſus Chriſt, and contrary to that exerciſe of love in wiſedom and mutual forbearance which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things I gather from this definition, and the Doctors diſcourſe in his Books.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he confines <hi>Schiſm</hi> to a particular Church onely.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Diviſions in a particular Church grow ſo high that divers of the members doe cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly make a Separation <hi>from</hi> the Church, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Communion with themſelves apart, that this is not Schiſm in the <hi>preciſe notion,</hi> however for diſputation-ſake againſt the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi>-men he may yield it to be ſo. <hi>The withdrawing from any Church or Society whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170413:7"/>upon the plea of its corruption, be it true</hi> of falſe, <hi>with a mind and reſolution to ſerve God in the due obſervation of Church Inſtitutions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that</hi> light <hi>which men have received, is no where called Schiſm,</hi> p. 46, &amp; 77. And <hi>Rev.</hi> p. 83.</p>
               <p>It is not <hi>called</hi> Schiſm, <hi>ergo</hi> it is not Schiſm. Will the conſequence hold, if the plea be falſe? What is it <hi>called?</hi> I pray. Welfare an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous conſcience; but ſuppoſe upon a falſe plea ſuch a conſcience ſhould raiſe diviſions in a Church, according to the definition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeparating <hi>from</hi> the Church; were it Schiſm or not?</p>
               <p>I thought by one paſſage in the Doctor's <hi>Pre-view,</hi> p. 54. I had miſtaken him; for thus he ſpeaks to Mr. <hi>C. If he ſuppoſe that I deny that to be Schiſm where there is a ſeparation, and that becauſe there is a ſeparation, as though Schiſm were in its</hi> whole nature <hi>excluſive of all ſeparation, and loſt its being when ſeparation enſued; he hath taken my mind as rightly as he hath done the whole deſign of my book.</hi> But adds withall, <hi>Becauſe this is not proved, I ſhall deſire him not to make uſe of it for the future, as though it were ſo.</hi> Theſe words I did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve till I had done.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If Schiſm in its <hi>whole nature</hi> will include cauſeleſs ſeparation <hi>from</hi> a particular Church, and this according to Scripture warrant, then the falſe plea of an erroneous conſcience for cauſeleſs ſeparation <hi>from</hi> a Church, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſerving God in his Inſtitutions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its <hi>light,</hi> muſt be <hi>Schiſm</hi> whether it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170413:8"/>be <hi>called</hi> ſo or not, unleſs you can tell us how elſe it is called.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why then doth the Doctor paſs by the definition of Schiſm ſo generally received? for he knows this is <hi>the</hi> thing which hath given that great offence, <hi>ſeparation from true Churches;</hi> and that which muſt ſatisfie here muſt be to prove that all this ſeparation is juſt and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable by Scripture; and if ſo, I know not who can charge theſe men with <hi>Schiſm,</hi> nor any thing elſe in <hi>ſo</hi> ſeparating: ſo that there was no need of departing from the definition generally received, and giving a new one, of which I know no uſe: unleſs, Firſt, To ſhew there can be no Schiſm in the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> And ſecondly, To ſhew that Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers may be guilty of Schiſm, though they do not ſeparate into parties, and ſo ſhew that our Churches are more guilty of Schiſm then we are aware of, which I believe to be true; but this will bring no honour I doubt to ſome Congregational Churches. Alas, what Schiſms have we known? this is ſo common a thing that a Divine whom I know, [and ſo doth the Doctor] once a high Congregational man, ſuffered much under that name, for whom my principles were not ſtrait enough, [but now he looks on me as erroneous, and too ſtrait, though I am the ſame I was then] being now turned about, and againſt all Congregational Churches, ſaith this of them, <hi>they will all break in pieces and come to nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the Reader be pleaſed to obſerve theſe paſſages in his books, then judge if I miſtake him.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:170413:8"/>1. In the ſame book where he ſpeaks ſo to Mr. <hi>C.</hi> who had ſaid there was a ſeparation into parties in the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> this the Doctor ſtifly denies, <hi>p.</hi> 70. and in <hi>p.</hi> 62. ſaith, <hi>The Schiſm the Apoſtle rebuked conſiſted in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> in <hi>it, and not in ſeparation</hi> from <hi>it.</hi> Then in <hi>p.</hi> 72. <hi>What that Schiſm was from which he dehorts them, he declares only in the inſtance of the Church of Corinth; and thence is the</hi> meaſure <hi>of it to be taken in reference to</hi> all <hi>dehorted from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence then we muſt dehort men from diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>in</hi> the Church, as being <hi>Schiſm,</hi> the <hi>meaſure</hi> allows it; but we muſt not dehort them from cauſeleſs ſeparation <hi>from</hi> a Church as being <hi>Schiſm,</hi> becauſe that <hi>only inſtance,</hi> which is the <hi>meaſure,</hi> doth not call it Schiſm. If that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> be the <hi>meaſure,</hi> what then doth not punctually agree with it is not Schiſm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In his book of Schiſm, <hi>p.</hi> 42. To this Q. <hi>[If any one now ſhall ſay, will you conclude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this evil mentioned by the Apoſtle is Schiſm, therefore nothing elſe is ſo?]</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I anſwer, that having before aſſerted this to be the</hi> chiefe <hi>and</hi> only ſeat <hi>of the doctrine of Schiſm, I am inclinable ſo to do.</hi> This inſtance is the <hi>only ſeat</hi> of the doctrine of Schiſm; but this inſtance ſpeaketh only of diviſion <hi>in</hi> the Church, not of ſeparation <hi>from</hi> it, ſaith he.</p>
               <p n="3">3. P. 193. Ib. <hi>Take it for a particular Church of Chriſt, I deny that ſeparation</hi> from <hi>a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, as ſuch, as meerly ſeparation, is Schiſm, or ought to be ſo eſteemed; though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſuch ſeparation may proceed from Schiſm, and be alſo attended with other evils.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:170413:9"/>
               <p>Who ever ſaid that <hi>meer ſeparation,</hi> ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all moral conſiderations from it, <hi>juſt</hi> or <hi>unjuſt,</hi> was Schiſm? we are ſpeaking of an unjuſt or cauſeleſs ſeparation <hi>from</hi> a Church, is that Schiſm? No, it ſeems.</p>
               <p>Before this cauſeleſs ſeparation, there was diviſion moſt likely <hi>in</hi> the Church, and this is allowed to be <hi>Schiſm;</hi> this Schiſm at laſt produces <hi>ſeparation cauſeleſly,</hi> but this <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is not Schiſm, nor muſt be ſo eſteemed, <hi>he ſaith.</hi> Compare this with his ſpeech to Mr. <hi>C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Doctor ſeems to define the <hi>whole nature</hi> of Schiſm, <hi>It is a cauſeleſs diviſion among members, &amp;c. meeting together for the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame numerical ordinances, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had he thought there might be ſchiſmatical acts beſides this Act in <hi>Corinth. viz.</hi> Cauſeleſs ſeparation <hi>from</hi> a Church which was not here, (he ſaith) then his work was only to deſcribe what was <hi>this</hi> Schiſm the Apoſtle reproves, and ſo ſhould have ſaid, <hi>This Schiſm was a cauſeleſs diviſion, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he defines, <hi>Schiſm is, &amp;c.</hi> And this agreeth with the Title of his Book, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to ſhew us the <hi>True nature</hi> of Schiſm, [hitherto miſtaken it ſeems by all Divines] and that definition the Doctor only embraceth; and for others he can own them againſt the Romaniſts <hi>ex abundanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> but no definition hath given the <hi>true nature</hi> of it but his. Nor doth the Doctor find fault with other mens defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe they miſtooke this particular act of Schiſm in <hi>Corinth,</hi> [which it may be they never intended, but to give the whole nature
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170413:9"/>of the ſin, as <hi>Logicians</hi> ſhould doe, and the true definition of the ſin will fetch in all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Acts] but he looks upon them all as not giving the <hi>true nature</hi> of Schiſm according to the <hi>preciſe notion</hi> of Scripture.</p>
               <p>What then the Doctor means by his words to Mr. <hi>Ca.</hi> I know not; theſe grounds I have laid down will clear that I am not miſtaken in what I gather from him.</p>
               <p>I ſee in his <hi>Rev.</hi> p. 85. he finds fault with Mr. <hi>Ca.</hi> becauſe he had ſaid that he delivered himſelf <hi>obſcurely.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Ca.</hi> is not the firſt man whom I have heard complain of <hi>obſcurity</hi> in his book, but divers others; I could ſet down their expreſſions, but forbear. In ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I obſerve things are not clear, and ſhould have taken ſome things in the ſame ſenſe Mr. <hi>Ca.</hi> hath done, for which the Doctor blames him. The Doctor then muſt pardon us though poor country-Miniſters are not ſo quick of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to find out his meaning.</p>
               <p>So far then as I underſtand the Doctor, I am not in divers things ſatisfied, and in particular not with his definition, which I doe not look upon as <hi>Logical.</hi> For, one rule of Definition is this.
<q>
                     <hi>Definitio ne-ſit anguſtior, neve latior ſuo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finito,</hi> but the Doctors definition is <hi>anguſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ſuo definito.</hi> Therefore not logical.</q> It is <hi>anguſtior</hi> in two reſpects. 1. It takes not in cauſeleſſe ſeparation <hi>from</hi> a Church, which I doubt not may be <hi>Schiſm.</hi> 2. It takes not in the Schiſm in the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> The Doctor ſaith there can be none. Whether there
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170413:10"/>can be no Schiſm <hi>from</hi> the Catholick Church, is a harder queſtion, it would ſeem rather to be <hi>Apoſtacie,</hi> as ſaith the Doctor; yet I do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt think we may ſuppoſe Schiſm to be <hi>from</hi> the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> But that there is Schiſm <hi>in</hi> the Catholick Church, I doubt not. Now if theſe two can be made good, then the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors definition is not <hi>logical.</hi> Every definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt <hi>exhaurire totam naturam [ſpecificam ſaltem] ſui definiti,</hi> elſe not <hi>adequate,</hi> nor <hi>reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal,</hi> which muſt be.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, Cauſeleſs ſeparation <hi>from</hi> a Church <hi>may</hi> be Schiſm. Why I put in the word, <hi>May,</hi> I ſhall give the reaſon afterwards.</p>
               <p>But it may be the Doctor may ſay,
<q>That definition of Schiſm which <hi>onely</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with Scripture, that, and that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is the true definition of Schiſm. But ſuch is mine. <hi>Ergo</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> [which I ſhall deny] he proves from this <hi>inſtance</hi> of the Church in <hi>Corinth.</hi> Where is no mention made of Separation <hi>from</hi> a Church, there was onely Diviſion in a Church.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Onely</hi> I put into the propoſition [and the Doctor himſelf ſpeaks as much, Here is the chief <hi>and</hi> onely <hi>ſeat of the doctrine of Schiſm,</hi> p. 42.] elſe though I yield ſuch a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition agrees with a particular inſtance, yet it agreeth not with the whole ſpecifical nature of the fin which we are enquiring into, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not logical. Doth every Scripture-inſtance give a full definition of the fin forbidden? The Command ſaith <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:170413:10"/>22.2. I finde mention made of a <hi>thief breaking in,</hi> &amp;c. to which Chriſt alludes <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.43. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there were no other inſtance of <hi>theft</hi> in all the Scripture, ſhall I now goe ſet forth a book about the <hi>true nature of theft,</hi> and goe to this Inſtance, and there ground my Definition, and ſay, <hi>Theft is an illegal and violent breaking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mans houſe and taking away goods againſt the owners will,</hi> and ſay nothing elſe can be <hi>Theft</hi> in the <hi>preciſe notion</hi> of Scripture, becauſe the Scripture-inſtance calls nothing elſe <hi>theft?</hi> This were ſtrange. Is not robbing at Sea <hi>theft,</hi> though no ſuch inſtance is found in Scripture? That definition given, <hi>Furtum eſt ablatio inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta rei alienae invito domino,</hi> will fetch in all <hi>theft.</hi> It is true, every particular Act of any ſin forbidden hath the ſpecifical nature of that ſin in it: If a man take my goods unjuſtly, whether it be at ſea, or on the high-way, out of my houſe openly or privately, and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways, all theſe have the ſpecifical nature of <hi>theft</hi> in them, and <hi>theft</hi> is predicated of them; we doe not make ſeveral definitions of theft becauſe there are ſeveral Acts: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nius rei una tantum eſt definitio.</hi> There may be divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the ſame ſin [as there is of Schiſm] yet <hi>gradus non variant ſpeciem.</hi> But we do not uſe to goe to particular Acts of any ſin, and out of ſuch an Act fetch the definition of the ſin confining the ſpecifical nature [which is more large] to that individual or ſingular Act.</p>
               <p>So here. There is a command given, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25. <hi>There muſt be no Schiſm in the body.</hi> Now if I would define <hi>Schiſm,</hi> muſt I goe to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

                  </gap> from that, and ſay <hi>this</hi> is Schiſm, and nothing elſe, Diviſion <hi>in</hi> a Church, but no cauſeleſſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration <hi>from</hi> a Church, becauſe there is no inſtance given where ſuch ſeparation is <hi>called</hi> Schiſm; as if we had particular inſtances in Scripture of all the acts of ſins forbidden in the ten commandements. It is true, <hi>that</hi> is Schiſm [<hi>i. e.</hi> the cauſeleffe Diviſion <hi>in</hi> the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> though they did not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>from</hi> it into parties, whether they did or no, I paſſe not] which here the Apoſtle reproves: But is nothing elſe Schiſm? Put caſe the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had riſen ſo high that <hi>Cephas</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had ſeparated from <hi>Apollos</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and held communion apart by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, had not this been Schiſm? give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Such ſeparation is not <hi>called</hi> Schiſm? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It cannot be <hi>called</hi> ſo unleſſe it <hi>were;</hi> the Doctor ſays it <hi>was not;</hi> we cannot expect the Scripture to give names to Acts as done, when they are not done. But <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> I ask the queſtion, if it had been ſo [as it is now common with us] that <hi>Cephas</hi> had ſeparated cauſeleſly, had it not been <hi>Schiſm?</hi> Certainly if <hi>Racha</hi> and <hi>thou fool</hi> be breaches of the ſixt Command, then if one adde to his word blows and wounds unjuſtly, that man is guilty of <hi>kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> alſo: So if <hi>Cephas</hi> and his company will adde Separation to Diviſion, and that unjuſtly, let <hi>Cephas</hi> pretend what he will, it is <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are divers profeſſors in theſe dayes, have been and would be eſteemed glorious
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170413:11"/>ones ſtill, who are ſo ſpiritual that they live <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> Ordinances [a carnal and wicked ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality] they have their grounds and pleas why they do ſo, but we find no ſuch Inſtance in all the Scripture, of men upon the plea of <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alneſs</hi> to live <hi>above</hi> them. Now to which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſhall we reduce this ſin, certainly a ſin it is; if I can find a command where the Lord hath inſtituted his external worſhip, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all to attend upon it, thither I reduce it, to the ſecond.</p>
               <p>So if men, though godly [for I know not but they have ſin, and the Devil may abuſe them] will cauſeleſly ſeparate, though they think not ſo, but plead this or that, becauſe I find no ſuch Inſtance in the Scripture, that men upon ſuch <hi>pleas</hi> have ſeparated, yet cauſeleſſe ſeparation is a ſin oppoſite to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> commanded; and I think <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> are <hi>oppoſite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Doctor then will give me [a poor Countrey-Miniſter] leave, I will humbly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the way I would take to find out the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Schiſm. I ſee it is a ſin, and offen-five to Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25. Now what is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to this, what is the affirmative precept? <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the members amongſt themſelves.</hi> This is the thing often commanded, the thing Chriſts heart ſeemed to be fixed upon, <hi>John</hi> 17. when he was leaving the world, and that ſuch Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as thereby the world may know whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples we are, as the Dr. p. 54. then I conceive <hi>Schiſm</hi> may be thus defined,
<note place="margin">Schiſm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</note>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Schiſm</hi> is the ſolution of that Unity which Chriſt our Head requireth in his Viſible Body.</q>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:170413:12"/>I am not in this place critical about the words <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> the Reader hath my meaning. I think the Dr. will not oppoſe this, for I find him enquiring exactly into the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible</hi> and <hi>Viſible Church,</hi> &amp;c. For the <hi>Inviſible</hi> Church of Chriſt, there can be no <hi>Schiſm,</hi> ſaith the Doctor; hence I put it not in. It muſt be in his <hi>viſible</hi> body, there I take in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church [which I look on as moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly his Body-viſible] and alſo particular Churches. I take this definition to be <hi>recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> I do not call to mind any ſchiſmatical Act but it will comprehend it, whether it be Schiſm <hi>in</hi> a Church, or from a Church; in the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> or <hi>particular</hi> Churches: and yet my ground is Scriptural alſo, though I go not to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence then let us ſee whether cauſeleſſe ſeparation <hi>from</hi> a Church be not <hi>properly</hi> Schiſm. Let us ſee what unity the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of this Church; was it onely that inward love and forbearance [which the Doctor men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions] which by their diviſions the Apoſtle ſaw they had broken? Did he not alſo require that they ſhould, as with reverence towards him, ſo with love one to another mutually and joyntly attend upon their <hi>Head</hi> in all his holy worſhip and ordiuances, Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors definition ſaith as much, <hi>Numerical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> &amp;c.] If then <hi>Cephas</hi> and his company had cauſeleſly made the diviſion, and upon this ſeparate from the reſt, and not joyn with them in the Supper [wherein they ſhew themſelves to be <hi>One bread, Chap.</hi> 10.17.] and other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170413:12"/>dinances, did they not manifeſtly ſhew a breach of that unity which the Lord required? muſt I not ſay, <hi>Cephas,</hi> you and your company are highly guilty of Schiſm? let the Reader judge. Thus then ſtands the argument.</p>
               <p>If cauſeleſſe ſeparation <hi>from</hi> a Church be a ſolution of that unity God requireth in his body, then cauſeleſſe ſeparation <hi>from</hi> a Church is Schiſm.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Antecedent</hi> is true: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent</hi> is true. The <hi>Conſequence</hi> is clear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In caſe theſe who made the Diviſion in <hi>Corinth</hi> had ſeparated <hi>from</hi> the other members, the Doctor grants it had been a greater ſin, <hi>Rev.</hi> p. 68. Since then we muſt not call it <hi>Schiſm,</hi> let the Doctor give us another <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture name</hi> for that ſin; let him ſet down the oppoſite affirmative precept, and ſee if Union will not be found in it. I doubt he will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find another Scripture-name, for I think he will hardly find in all the Bible where godly men, or ſuch as appeared ſo, dared ever to make a cauſeleſſe ſeparation <hi>from</hi> a Church. To ſay it is <hi>Apoſtacie,</hi> no ſtay; I will ſuppoſe thoſe members who thus divide, to be perſons ſound in the main points of faith, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation viſibly godly, ſuch as maintain the Ordinances of God amongſt themſelves [the very caſe of divers of ours] but corprution and errour in this point hath divided <hi>Cephas</hi> and his company; now here is no <hi>Apoſtaſie:</hi> And though it be a Church guilty of Schiſm, and ſo far a <hi>ſchiſmatical Church,</hi> yet a true Church. Hence I ſaid a cauſeleſſe ſeparation, <hi>&amp;c may</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:170413:13"/>be Schiſm, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuppoſing they hold to what before I mentioned, elſe it fell from the faith, &amp;c. it had been <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and not properly <hi>Schiſm,</hi> unleſs you will ſay <hi>both.</hi> Hence</p>
               <list>
                  <item>If cauſeleſs ſeparation <hi>from</hi> a Church hath no other name given it in Scripture, nor can rationally be referred to any other head then. <hi>Schiſm,</hi> then cauſeleſs ſeparation from a Church is Schiſm.</item>
                  <item>But the Antecedent is true:</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>ergo</hi> the Conſequent is true.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The conſequence is clear, becauſe it partakes of the nature of no ſin, as of Schiſm: [pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided thoſe who ſeparate be ſuch as before I mentioned.]</p>
               <p n="3">3. Since the Doctor makes this inſtance the <hi>only ſeat of the doctrine of Schiſm,</hi> and tieth us up ſo ſtreightly to it, I was thinking whether it would not hence follow that there can be no Schiſm in any Church but onely in ſuch Churches as do exactly anſwer this inſtance; &amp; hence Schiſm muſt be only in ſuch Churches where there are diverſity of Officers, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts, differences about <hi>meats,</hi> &amp;c. thus I hope moſt Churches are uncapable of Schiſm; and that ſin will hardly be found in our days. It may be he will ſay, by <hi>conſequence</hi> it will follow where there are cauſeleſs differences, where the <hi>form</hi> of the ſin is found, there is the ſin of Schiſm, though Churches do not anſwer <hi>Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what the Doctor ſaith, that the Scripture doth not <hi>call cauſeleſs ſeparation</hi> from <hi>a Church Schiſm.</hi> So I can ſay, this Scripture inſtance,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170413:13"/>calls that only Schiſm, where ſome were for <hi>Cephas,</hi> others for <hi>Apollos,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But further, let us enquire into the <hi>form</hi> of the ſin where it is. <hi>In the diviſion amongst the members to the diſturbance of the order in the worſhip of God, &amp;c.</hi> I wiſh the Doctor had told us how that order was diſturbed; ſome things he doth mention, but whether all the diſorder in the worſhip of God be recorded, I know not; and that which is recorded admits of ſome queſtions to be reſolved before we can clearly underſtand it. As for the <hi>diſturbance of the order,</hi> I ſuppoſe he doth not make that the <hi>form</hi> of the ſin of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> nor part of it; I look on it rather as a <hi>conſequent</hi> of the Schiſm, therefore not the <hi>form;</hi> neither do I look on <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi> properly as contrary, where <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num uni tantum opponitur,</hi> they do not <hi>comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus inter ſe pugnare per proximas formas.</hi> Nor am I certain that there was ever <hi>Schiſm</hi> where yet ſome diſorder have been found. I cannot tell that there was <hi>Schiſm</hi> amongſt the <hi>Prophets.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. but ſome <hi>diſorder</hi> there was in the exerciſe of their gifts, as it ſhould ſeem by the laſt <hi>Verſe,</hi> the Apoſtle calls for <hi>order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eccleſiaſtical union cauſeleſly diſſolved,</hi> I take to be the <hi>form</hi> of Schiſm; this is it by which Schiſm is <hi>id quod eſt.</hi> If then the Doctor will allow that Schiſm may be in Churches by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,</hi> though the cauſes be not ſuch as were in <hi>Corinth,</hi> northe Churches parallel to <hi>Corinth</hi> in all things, becauſe there is the <hi>form</hi> of that ſin which was in <hi>Corinth</hi> called <hi>Schiſm;</hi> then if canſeleſs ſeparation <hi>from</hi> a Church, be <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170413:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>union cauſeleſly diſſolved,</hi> there muſt needs by <hi>conſequence</hi> be Schiſm alſo, for <hi>poſita forma ponitur formatum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Doctor tells us the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>To ſearch over other Divines to ſee what they had ſaid about <hi>Schiſm</hi> I thought it in vain, becauſe the Doctor had laid a bar againſt them all, <hi>they are all miſtaken,</hi> and ſo their authority is worth nothing; but when I had done, two men came into my mind, who were neer to the Doctor's principles, being Congregational men, and therefore had need to look to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their definition of Schiſm, men of great renown for learning and piety, Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> and our Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in <hi>N. E.</hi> in anſwer to the Q. <hi>Quid eſt ſchiſma?</hi> I find <hi>Ames</hi> thus anſwers, <hi>Schiſma dicitur a ſcindendo, &amp; eſt ſciſſio,</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio, <hi>disjunctio, aut diſſolutio <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nionis illius quae debet inter Chriſtianos obſervari.</hi> I was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170413:15"/>neerer to the Doctor's definition then I was aware of; but then he adds, <hi>Quia autem haec ſciſſio maxime perficitur, &amp; apparet in debita Communione Eccleſiaſtica recuſanda, idcirco illa</hi> ſeparatio <hi>per appropriationem ſingularem, recte vocatur Schiſma;</hi> thus he.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> thus, <hi>Schiſma eſt illicita ſeparatio a Communione Eccleſiae; ſemper grande malum.</hi> I will look no further, theſe are ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>Catholick-Church,</hi> I am to prove there may be Schiſm in it. For my ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work I lay that Text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25. <hi>That there ſhould be no Schiſm in the body.</hi>

               <list>
                  <item>If by the <hi>body</hi> in this text be meant the <hi>Catholick-Church viſible,</hi> then Schiſm may be in the Catholick-Church viſible.</item>

               <p>The Antecedent is to be proved.

But I had thought that by <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Teachers, Helps, Governments, v.</hi> 28. he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpoken of office, power, and authority: are gifts and graces meant by theſe words? very ſtrange. But to come to our Text.</p>
               <p>If the Church be here meant, then it is either the Church inviſible or viſible. But not the inviſible, that the Chapter clears; and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſaith, It's impoſſible Schiſm ſhould be in the <hi>inviſible</hi> Church.</p>

               <p>This I grant, that by <hi>body</hi> in one Text, <hi>v.</hi> 27. a particular Church is mentioned, becauſe the Apoſtle applies what he had been ſpeaking of before to this particular Church, being a <hi>ſimilar</hi> part of the Church-Catholick, as our Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> and other Divines in the definition of a particular Church; [though ſome Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians make different definitions, as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>form</hi> of a ſimilar part, yet I content my ſelf with that definition which is commonly given.] What duties are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned the <hi>Catholick-Church,</hi> or what ſins are forbidden, theſe concern every particular Church; for Chriſt giveth his <hi>Laws</hi> to the Catholick-Church <hi>primarily,</hi> no particular Church hath a ſpecial law given to it <hi>as ſuch:</hi> whence well may the Apoſtle apply his ſpeech to this particular Church; but that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was not diſcourſing of a particular Church, in viewing over the Chapter theſe arguments perſwade me.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is ſuch a body into which <hi>we are all baptized, v.</hi> 13. but are we baptized into a <hi>particular Church?</hi> is that the <hi>one body</hi> the Apoſtle means? Let the Doctor ſpeak, <hi>Rev.</hi> p. 134. <hi>I am ſo far from confining Baptiſm ſubjectively to a particular Congregation, that I do not believe that any member of a particular Church was ever regularly baptized.</hi> As much he ſeems to intimate, <hi>Schiſ. p.</hi> 133. in his anſwer to this queſtion, <hi>wherein conſiſts the unity of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-Church?</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:170413:16"/>A. <hi>It is ſummoned up in Eph.</hi> 4.5. one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm. <hi>It is the unity of the doctrine of faith which men profeſs, in ſubjection to one Lord, Jeſus Chriſt, being ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated into that profeſſion</hi> [and ſo that body] <hi>by Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſuch a body as with its head makes up <hi>Chriſt, v.</hi> 12. But if one particular Church related to its head be <hi>Chriſt,</hi> what are all the other? how many <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſhall we have? For my part I conceive, as <hi>all</hi> true believers make up but one ſpiritual body, to which Chriſt is a ſaving and ſpiritual head; ſo all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches in the world are but one body viſible, of which Chriſt is the Political Head. Every true believer is ſaid to be married to Chriſt, and of this Church, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>he had eſpouſed them to Chriſt,</hi> and are not thouſands more? but we do not read <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Brides ſay Come;</hi> nor of the <hi>Lambs wives, ch.</hi> 21.9. but the Lambs <hi>Bride</hi> and <hi>Wife:</hi> thus the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick viſible body is called the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Chriſt, not <hi>Kingdoms;</hi> though by reaſon of the numberleſs number, the Lord bids one Paſtour, feed you my flock <hi>there,</hi> and another, feed you my flock <hi>there, &amp;c.</hi> yet but <hi>one flock, one body;</hi> theſe meetings of this great body being in a manner accidental to the Church-Catholick, by reaſon of the numeroſity of its members, for could we conceive that all the members of this Church could meet in one place, and partake of the ſame numerical or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances orderly, this meeting in ſeveral places ſhould ceaſe.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:170413:16"/>3. It is ſuch a body as hath <hi>Apoſtles ſet in it, v.</hi> 28. but though the Apoſtles were officers to this particular Church, yet not to this <hi>only,</hi> but to the Catholick.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is ſuch a body that the members of it <hi>ſuffer together, and rejoyce together, v.</hi> 26. but this mutual rejoycing and ſympathy, is not confined to the members of that particular Church, I hope? the ſame <hi>ſpecifical</hi> care, though not the ſame <hi>gradual</hi> care, I think ſuch a diſtinction may help to underſtand the 25. <hi>v.</hi> for I conceive there is ſome neerer tie to my own members in particular, as to my own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and yet to have no care of other members of another Church, though I ſee them in danger of ſin, or require of me the diſpenſing of an rdinance, (regularly) &amp;c. I think this is not right. Then 27. <hi>v.</hi> what I have ſaid of the great body, I ſay to you who are a <hi>ſimilar</hi> part of this great body, and ſo called the <hi>body</hi> of Chriſt, Do ye take heed there be no <hi>Schiſm</hi> amongſt you.</p>
               <p>Thus that parallel Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4, 5. ſeems to be meant not of the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Catholick; <hi>many</hi> members, but <hi>one</hi> body.</p>
               <p>When I can ſee better reaſons given me to prove he is diſcourſing of a <hi>particular Church,</hi> I ſhall yield to them.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But how can Schiſm be in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-Church viſible?</hi> this muſt be enquired into, though I fail in the opening of it, yet what I have ſaid to the Text before will ſave me.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:170413:17"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I muſt premiſe ſome things, then come to the anſwer. The Doctor <hi>p.</hi> 133. <hi>Schiſ.</hi> ſpeaking of the Catholick-Church, ſaith, <hi>The ſaving do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, and obedience through him to God, as profeſſed by them, is the bond of that union whereby they are made one body.</hi> But [under favour] I conceive the Doctor hath expreſſed only that bond which is between the <hi>body</hi> and the <hi>head;</hi> but are there no ligaments whereby the joynts of this great body are knit to each other? ſurely if a body, there are ſuch; the Apoſtle <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. I think ſpeaks of a bond among the members; and by the 11. <hi>v.</hi> he ſeems to me to ſpeak of the <hi>Catholick-Church-viſible, from whom the whole body fitly joyned together, and compacted by that which every joynt ſupplieth, according to the effectual working in the meaſure of every part maketh increaſe of the body unto the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it ſelf in love.</hi> Upon which words <hi>Zanchy</hi> thus, <hi>Concludere vult Apoſtolus quod initio propoſuerat, fovendam eſſe unitatem hujus corporis myſtici per vinculum pacis: Ratio, quia ita ſe habet hoc corpus, ut niſi quis per fidem vivam amoriſque plenam cum Chriſto conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus, &amp; per fraternam caritatem cum fratribus totaque eccleſia congruenter coagmentatus permàneat, is non poſſit a Chriſto vel vitam vel alimentum &amp; incrementum accipere.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Chryſoſt. Maſculus</hi> thus, <hi>Dilectio conglutinat membra Chriſti;</hi> and a little before <hi>Nihil igitur hic loci eſt ſeparatis ac divulſis, quales quales tandem eſſe videantur.</hi> With theſe agree <hi>Beza.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170413:17"/>Charity is the knitting of the limbs together. Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> uſe to be joyned together; if the Apoſtle doth expreſs it as the <hi>bond,</hi> ſurely we may call it ſo; and thus we have the <hi>body</hi> united to the head, and each member one to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the preſervation of this union</hi> [ſaith the Doctor] <hi>it is required that all thoſe grand and neceſſary truths of the Goſpel, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge where of no man can be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, be ſo far believed, as to be outwardly and viſibly profeſſed, in that variety of ways wherein they are, or may be called out thereunto, p.</hi> 134. To which I add; and unto the preſervation of that <hi>bond</hi> of union among the members, it's required that all ſuch Acts which do exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally declare this bond of love whereby theſe members are joyned together, <hi>as ſuch a body,</hi> ought carefully and Chriſtianly to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, when we are regularly called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; this <hi>bond</hi> of Love ſo much commanded and prayed for by our Head, being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a particular Church, but extended to the whole Catholick Church his body, by which men ſhew whoſe Diſciples they are.</p>
               <p>Hence then as all ſuch errors which ſubvert thoſe grand and neceſſary Truths, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and believed, do diſſolve the bond of union between the head and the members, and declare men to be Apoſtates; So all ſuch Acts as do openly manifeſt the cauſeleſs breach of Love, by which the members are united each to other, do declare ſuch perſons guilty of Schiſm. <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> [as I conceive] properly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170413:18"/>reſpecting the <hi>Head,</hi> but <hi>Schiſm</hi> the Body. Now in reference to this I lay down theſe Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The members of this great Body in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon thoſe ordinances of worſhip inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Head, eſpecially the <hi>two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> doe declare that faith in their Head which they profeſſe. Open <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> we finde nothing there but <hi>Chriſt;</hi> open the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> we have nothing there but <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Head, and the grand and neceſſary Truths which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our ſalvation: As the Martyrs ſealed up their <hi>Confeſſions</hi> by their blood, we doe, as it were, ſeal up our <hi>Profeſſion</hi> in partaking of our Lords blood.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The members of the Church in partaking of the Sacraments doe profeſſedly declare that Union which they have among themſelues by love, as <hi>ſuch a body.</hi> It is one reaſon why the Lords Supper is called a <hi>Communion,</hi> and it is one of the ends of the Sacrament, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nio fidelium inter ſe,</hi> as Divines doe unanimouſly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge upon that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Fractio panis eſt unitatis &amp; dilectionis Symbolum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pareus.</hi> Much might be here ſpoken. I know there are other wayes by which Chriſtians manifeſt their love, and ſo did Heathens in ſuch manner as now is ſcarcely found amongſt Chriſtians; but for the manifeſtation of their love to each other <hi>as ſuch a body,</hi> there is no way that I know of, nor no ordinance in which they do ſo declare it as in this ordinance, wherein <hi>they, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are one bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Sacraments were not given to a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:170413:18"/>Church <hi>primarily,</hi> but to his <hi>Catholick</hi>-Body the Lord gave them; and ſo are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal pledges of the bond of union between the members of this great body. That the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments come to be adminiſtred in ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſocieties, I gave the reaſon before, ſeeming ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be accidental to the Catholick Church, by reaſon of the numeroſity of its members. That body which the bread ſignifies in the Supper is but one body, and the members of the Catholick body make but <hi>one bread.</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt with his body make one Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. The Sacraments doe ſhew our union with our Head Chriſt <hi>primarily,</hi> and the union of the members amongſt themſelves. I know a perſon who had received wrong from another who lived 40. miles diſtant: this wrong cauſed a diviſion between this perſon and the other, upon which this perſon durſt not venture to the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> but kept off till reconciliation was made, knowing what the Supper did call for, then came to me and joyned in the ordinance; I knew not the reaſon of this perſon's holding off ſo long before. If the Sacraments were pledges only of that Love or Communion which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the members of a <hi>particular Church,</hi> what needed the conſcience of this perſon to have been troubled, ſince the other perſon had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to our Church. This was one bred up in the Epiſcopal way, but it were well if others made ſo much conſcience as this perſon did in this reſpect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence then that Church which ſhall deny to the members of other Churches [qualified
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170413:19"/>as the Doctor requires <hi>Catholick</hi> members to be, and walking orderly in their particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches] occaſionally deſiring communion with the Church, fellowſhip with them in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe they are not of their judgments as to <hi>Congregational, Claſſical,</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> principles, and will hold fellowſhip onely with thoſe who are of their principles, I charge that Church with <hi>Schiſm</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> by this Act declaring a breach of that bond of union which Chriſt requires in his Church.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But we may love them, and ſhew our love in other wayes, though we doe not this way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So doe the Heathen ſhew love to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and ſo doe we to Heathen, though we will not admit them to communion in a Church-ordinance; but that Symbol of your loue to him or them <hi>as Chriſtians,</hi> as members of <hi>ſuch a body</hi> having union with your Head, and union with you alſo who are of the ſame body making up one <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And whereas one while you dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them to be viſible members of Chriſt, being qualified according to the rules for Catholick members, and having all the Ordinances and Officers of Chriſt according to their <hi>light</hi> in their particular Churches; yet now as much as in you lies you declare them to have no union with the Head, nor to be parts of the Catholick Body, neither the members refuſed, nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Churches to which they belong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame judgment. So that while you talk of <hi>Love,</hi> I ſay as the Apoſtle, <hi>Shew me thy
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170413:19"/>faith by thy works;</hi> ſo ſhew me your <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal love by Church-fellowſhip.</hi> To this opinion of mine Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> in the place before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted agreeth fully. <hi>Haec ſciſſio maxime perficitur &amp; apparet in debita communione Eccleſiaſtica recuſanda,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus I conceive Congregational, Claſſical, or Epiſcopal Churches may be guilty of Schiſm, and cauſe Schiſm in the <hi>Catholick-Church-Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for that Doctrine, That an Officer of a particular Church muſt adminiſter an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to none but his own members. This is confuted in the practice of all Churches that I know of, and I ſuppoſe will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
               <p>To this I add: Suppoſe there be divers mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſeveral particular Churches, who are very zealous for <hi>Propheſying,</hi> and they muſt have their liberty to propheſie, whether they have abilities or not; the Churches conceive that the gift of <hi>Propheſying,</hi> being extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is ceaſed, therefore will allow no ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Theſe are ſo ſet for their Propheſying, that they make Diviſions in the Churches, and at laſt ſeparate from them all, and make up one Church by themſelves; they are qualified as the Doctor requires Catholick members; they have all the ordinances and officers of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; whence I cannot deny but here is a Church, but yet they refuſe communion with all other Churches in the world, unleſs of their opinion, neither <hi>give</hi> nor <hi>take,</hi> though deſired; and there are no other Churches in the world
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170413:20"/>of their opinion or practice. Now this Church I cannot charge with Apoſtaſie from the Head, but with ſeparation <hi>from</hi> the Catholick Church, and ſo is guilty of <hi>Schiſm.</hi> If it be ſaid this Church is a part of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> how then ſeparate <hi>from</hi> it? It's true, elſe it were not <hi>Schiſm,</hi> but Apoſtaſie; but as it ſeparates <hi>from all</hi> other Churches cauſeleſly, in that ſenſe I ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of the <hi>Doctors Definition.</hi> As for his Deſign to free <hi>All</hi> the Congregational Churches from the imputation of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> though we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Schiſm to be a cauſeleſſe ſeparation from a Church,</hi> I had rather wave that then goe about to prove the contrary, and that partly becauſe of the honour which I bear to many of theſe brethren; partly becauſe I know not the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of <hi>all</hi> Congregational Churches: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of Mr. <hi>Ca.</hi> mind, if by the title of his book [as I find it quoted by the Doctor, for I never ſaw Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi>] <hi>Independencie is great Schiſm,</hi> he means that <hi>congregational princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will neceſſarily conclude a man a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi> Certainly from the principles as our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in <hi>New-England</hi> hold them forth, ſuch a neceſſity of Schiſm will not be forced; but whether <hi>all</hi> in <hi>England</hi> can quit themſelves I doubt it. What ſome may think of me who find me in Mr. <hi>Edwards gang</hi> amongſt the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,</hi> and now read this, I know not. Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they wil ſay either Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> wrote what was falſe, or that I am changed from my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples [as ſome have ſaid] but I aſſure the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I am not gone back, nor advanced one ſtep
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170413:20"/>in theſe controverſies, from what I ever mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in thoſe times when thoſe letters were ſent to Mr. <hi>Edwards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I intend not to follow the Dr. in all that he hath written, but to come to the point preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In <hi>p.</hi> 263. the Dr. tells us <hi>He dare boldly ſay, the holy Ghoſt hath commanded a Schiſm from a congregation that is not reformed, will not, nor cannot reform it ſelf.</hi> with <hi>p.</hi> 262. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.12. If the Dr. apply theſe Texts to our ſeparations which ſome congregational Churches make, I queſtion whether they will carry the thing he produces them for. But to be ſhort: I will not ſay the Holy Ghoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Schiſm,</hi> but <hi>Separation</hi> in ſome caſes he doth; therein I agree with the Doctor, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly practice [different from my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren] but it is onely within my own congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, denying to admit thoſe who are, as Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> calls the generality of the people in this Land, <hi>Bruits for their knowledge, and beaſts for their lives,</hi> and ſo will be unto the ſeals of the covenant of grace.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sacram.</hi> p. 152.</note> So I have made a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>in</hi> the congregation, but not from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Had I read that the Apoſtles had ſtood upon the reality of grace in their admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Church-fellowſhip, I would have been as ſtrict as ſome brethren ſay they are; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find it not in their practice, I look on it as mens <hi>adding</hi> to the Word, and ſo let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>But our queſtion is not whether <hi>any</hi> Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but whether <hi>ſuch</hi> a Separation be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as thus. Here is a Church where are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170413:21"/>many corrupt members, that is true; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all here are 1. <hi>many real and viſible Saints.</hi> 2. <hi>A Paſtor godly, ſound in doctrine, and able for his work, preaching Chriſt ſoundly.</hi> 3. <hi>The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in themſelves clear from humane mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> 4. <hi>Though here are corrupt members, yet when the Lords Supper is celebrated, they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, not admitted, but there is a pure lump.</hi> 5. <hi>The Church is not puffed up, but rather grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that there are ſo many corrupt members a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, but according to their light, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many, know not how to caſt them out, left there by other mens ſins, but bear this evil with complaint and prayer to God for healing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding a few of theſe Viſible Saints, the <hi>minor</hi> part be ſure [we obſerve] ſhall make ſeparation, not onely from the corrupt members, but from the <hi>major</hi> part of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and viſible Saints, from that godly Paſtor, having no communion with theſe, no not in the <hi>Supper</hi> where they are a pure lump; and yet this <hi>minor</hi> part have not done their part to reform theſe corrupt members. If the Holy Ghoſt hath commanded ſuch a Separation, I pray Doctor quote the texts where we may find it. I fear he will hardly find three texts for ſuch a Separation; yet I know where ſuch Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, and of theſe men complain. If he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce Scriptures, he hath ſaid nothing to many of our Separations.</p>
               <p>The Dr. I perceive ſpeaks much of <hi>original Inſtitution</hi> and <hi>primitive Conſtitution</hi> of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but I ſhall deſire him to ſhew us the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures where the Apoſtles did uſe to goe to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170413:21"/>Congregations where indeed were divers corrupt members, but withal many godly, at leaſt viſible Saints, who had walked before with their godly Paſtors in conſtant attendance upon and ſubjection to the Ordinances of Chriſt; and there the Apoſtles did pick out ſome of the beſt of the members, and leaving the Paſtor and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers grieved, weakened, and thus did conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Churches: I cannot remember any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which ſhews this was their practice, whence I doubt this kind of conſtitution is not ſo <hi>old,</hi> but rather had its <hi>original</hi> ſince 1640. As for <hi>Parochial Precincis,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak to them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But why then doe not theſe godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and viſible Saints you ſpeak of, ſeparate the profane and groſſely ignorant from their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, but ſinfully retain them, or at leaſt ſuffer them to abide with them? If they did ſo, they ſhould not be troubled with godly mens ſeparating from them; they ſweep not the Lords houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whether godly men would not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate then I cannot tell: If the Apoſtles rules of admiſſion were ſufficient to guide us, there might be more hopes they would not. But when men ſet up rules themſelves, and all men muſt come to their rules and wayes, they would be as apt to ſeparate from thoſe whom the Apoſtles would admit, I think they would be almoſt as eager for ſeparation as now.</p>
               <p>Whether thoſe Paſtors and Saints viſible doe ſinfully ſuffer ſuch in their Churches, and ſo are blame-worthy, I diſpute not; but as to the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170413:22"/>preſent ſtate of theſe Churches left ſuch by the negligence &amp; ſin of thoſe who uſurped the power over them, whence ſome will ſcarce own them for Churches, and others plead ſo much for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from them, ſomething may be fairly offered, which may plead for them. True it is, men of great <hi>grace,</hi> great <hi>gifts,</hi> great <hi>purſes,</hi> great <hi>courage,</hi> great <hi>favour with great men,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>chiefeſt perſons</hi> in a Town on their ſides [which <hi>laſt</hi> was my advantage in this ſmall village] may doe more towards the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their particular congregations, then other men can doe who are not ſo advantaged. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial</hi> and <hi>Curſt</hi> Divines, who being aloft eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, conſider not the tentations of men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, are not ſuch honourable men with me as ſome others are. Thoſe men who have lien in pickle in the brine of varieties of tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions twenty years, have known by experience the evils of debts, poverty joyned to great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-charges, low gifts, deſperate workings of ſpiritual and fleſhly corruptions, ſenſe of guilt; theſe are the men who ſhall write practical books for me; theſe, I doubt not, will write low, and ſpeak low; theſe will feel their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns temptations. But to the point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe men doe ſeparate at the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and there allow them no communion. This is attained with much difficulty in our dayes; we know they contend much for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The moſt they doe is, they admit their children to Baptiſm, which conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not profane; and were Baptiſm ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by that latitude which the Apoſtles
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170413:22"/>did adminiſter it, I doubt not but many may be admitted to it.</p>
               <p>Now in that this is all the priviledge they have, more then theſe men who ſeparate will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, the queſtion is, whether there be nothing conſiderable to ſway men to this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a queſtion diſputable, whether the immediate Parents onely can give title; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Grandfather, or Grandmother, being in covenant, may not help to give title to a grandchild. Upon this account divers admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a queſtion, whether if others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the covenant will undertake the education of ſuch children, may they not be baptized? [as our Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> conceives they may.]</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are eminent Divines who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that though the Parents be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet the child of ſuch ought to be baptized, <hi>Zanch. Perkins,</hi> and divers whom I could name. Now if this be true, then though all theſe were <hi>excommunicated,</hi> which is the moſt thoſe who ſeparate can deſire, yet their children ſhould be baptized, which is all the priviledge theſe men have though not excommunicated, and which thoſe who ſeparate can ſtumble at. For the reſt of the Ordinances we admit <hi>Indians</hi> to, I hope they will not deny them admiſſion to thoſe.</p>
               <p>I omit that great queſtion, whether Baptiſm be not a <hi>Regenerating Ordinance,</hi> which divers Learned men abroad and at home doe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and have Scriptures which ſpeak very fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170413:23"/>for them, ſo much, as I can ſcarcely be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the anſwers our Divines have given to thoſe texts they bring.</p>
               <p>Now though I have not ſo much <hi>light</hi> to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me in any of theſe opinions, and convince me fully of their truth; yet I ſee ſo much argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them, that I am very tender towards thoſe who goe upon theſe grounds, whatever arguments I have againſt them which carry me another way; and were I a private member of one of thoſe Churches where there were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thoſe viſible Saints, an able godly Paſtor, and the Supper kept as I ſaid, I ſhould not dare to ſeparate from it as others doe.</p>
               <p>I might adde to this how ſome Miniſters, though they doe baptize, yet they deal round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firſt with the Parents, and ſo as ſome will come no more at them for Baptiſm. And one, an Epiſcopal Divine of eminent note, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to adminiſter Baptiſm to the children of ſuch parents as he found ſottiſhly ignorant, but ſent them back firſt to learn the principles of Religion, and aſſent to them.</p>
               <p>So that had theſe who ſeparate ſtuck cloſe to their Miniſters, and encouraged them in thus dealing with thoſe ſcandalous perſons in private, they might have done more towards reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then now they have done.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There were divers corrupt members in <hi>Corinth,</hi> and their children baptized; for ought I know a fault might be in the Officers, and better part, but no command to ſeparate from the Officers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Should all the godly Miniſters in <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:170413:23"/>ſeparate, as theſe men would have us, and goe by their rules in admiſſion of Church-members, I queſtion whether there would be a godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter left in <hi>England,</hi> the common people would not bear it. And verily for godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to ſuffer death in things ſo diſputable, wherein holy men and Martyrs before did walk without any ſcruple, having ſo much probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from Scripture [as that argument of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, with the reſt before mentioned] but yet more, to ſuffer for rules which themſelves made, &amp; not the Apoſtles, this is a hard chapter; thoſe who are ſo free of their lives may take their courſe. I will bleſſe the Lord if he ſhall pleaſe to aſſiſt me with grace to lay down my life for him [if he ſhall call me to it] in things where I am confident I know his mind, and the Scriptures are ſo clear that I need not doubt, and in the mean time thank God I meet with ſuch as will bear with me in things wherein I differ from them of leſſe concernment, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments caſting me on that ſide, but not without great ſcruples on the other ſide. I hear great words from ſome of theſe, they will not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice any thing but what they are ready to lay down their lives for. I dare not ſpeak ſuch great words.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe men who thus ſeparate, when as yet there is nothing but the baptizing of their Infants they can object againſt, yet allow in their Churches, and think we are bound to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch who deny all <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> and will call the Anabaptiſtical Churches true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Theſe who caſt off all the Infant-poſterity of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170413:24"/>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> from <hi>Church-memberſhip:</hi> theſe men muſt be admitted to the <hi>Supper,</hi> and what not: the others are debarred from the Supper, but their Infants baptized, which of theſe two is the worſt I wonder? for my part I would rather baptize the child of a wicked man, profeſſing Chriſt in words, then not baptize the child of a godly man; more reaſon and Scripture may be alledged for it. Whence me thinks the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, being ſuch a ſtrong Champion for Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, may allow unto the Presbyterial Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſome benefit of his opinion: for Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is <hi>Malorum,</hi> and if this be evil, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume he looks on the Anabaptiſtical opinion as evil alſo; and if this muſt be tolerated in Churches, and doth not weaken the purity of the Church, why the other ſhould not have ſome allowance I know not.</p>
               <p>I know no underſtanding man that is againſt Toleration <hi>ſimply,</hi> he that will allow none is not fit to live in theſe times; but how far we are bound to Tolerate, is a hard queſtion.</p>
               <p>To conclude,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reſpon. ad Apol.</hi> 168.</note> I ſhall only ſee what our Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> a man who in ſome caſes allows ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from a true Church, and one that in the Congregational way is <hi>Theologus cum primis nobilis,</hi> to that queſtion <hi>how is ſeceſſion to be made from a true Church?</hi> anſwers thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Not without due vſe of all means to remove the impurities.</hi> I am ſure amongſt thoſe means this is one, for theſe to bear witneſs againſt the ſcandalous members, and labour in their places to get them removed regularly; thoſe then who never deal with any of theſe in a

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Concerning the</hi> Parochial <hi>Congregations in</hi> England.</head>
               <p>I took it for granted that our Congregational brethren did look on the Parochial Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations where they came, and have gathered Churches as <hi>true</hi> Churches before they came there, and ſo did not lay new foundations, or gather Churches where there were none before, only the Congregations being over-grown with perſons groſly ignorant and ſcandalous for want of Catechizing and Diſcipline, they did ſegregate ſuch perſons from Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, till they got ſo much as might declare them to be viſible Saints. But one of theſe Miniſters tell me I am miſtaken: if I be, then I underſtand not our brethren all this while, nor do I know when I ſhall: for my part I have ever profeſſed, I looked on the Parochial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations as a true Church before I came to it, though over-grown [as before I ſaid:] Thoſe who were here and elected me to be their officer, I look on my ſelf as having ſufficient authority over them by their election; thoſe who have come into Town ſince, I do require their owning of me for their officer [knowing that government here is founded upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent] and ſubjection to <hi>all</hi> ordinances, if they demand the ordinances of me; ſo far I go along with our brethren. <hi>That many Parochial
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170413:26"/>Congregations are true Churches,</hi> I doubt not, though the Presbyterial brethren have not proceeded ſo far as others have done, and therefore the Congregational Brethren may ſafely have communion with them. Some things let me premiſe, and then I will give one argument or two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The want of ſome ordinances in a Church deſtroys not the <hi>truth</hi> of the Church. Then there can be no <hi>homogeneal</hi> Church; our brethren I hope will not allow the Fraternity being deſtitute of officers to <hi>baptize,</hi> &amp;c. but yet a <hi>homogeneal</hi> Church they maintain; much might be ſpoken here, but I forbear. <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline</hi> which ſome alledge, as being wanting in theſe Parochial Churches, do not therefore deny them to be <hi>true</hi> Churches, [which yet in part they had, for <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> it is well known.] The <hi>Rod</hi> is not of the eſſence of the <hi>family,</hi> though the children may do ill where it is wanting. <hi>Feaſt of Tabernacles, Neh.</hi> 8.17. was long wanting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An officer uſurping power in a Church, doth not deſtroy the <hi>truth</hi> of the Church. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes</hi> took more then was due. The Biſhops were but Miniſters, and did miniſterial work, if they took more power then the Lord gave them, yet that doth not hinder the <hi>truth</hi> of the Churches. What ſhall be ſaid then to the Biſhops in the primitve Churches; I wiſh I had as much zeal and love to Chriſt as they had.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though many members be corrupt in doctrine and manners, yet they do not take away the truth of a Church. <hi>Corinth</hi> had too
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170413:26"/>many of theſe, and the officers might be faulty in tolerating of them, but yet a true Church; and I hardly think that <hi>Paul</hi> would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed communion with the Church. I doubt not but other Churches alſo had bad members. The Churches which lived under Heatheniſh perſecution were true Churches; yet there are foul ſcandalous ſins reported of ſome of the members.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Reality of grace, though deſireable, O very deſireable, yet is not abſolutely requiſite to the making of a viſible Church; though I think it is hard to find ſuch a Church, yet I know not but according to the rules we muſt go by in admitting of Church-members, there may be a true <hi>viſible</hi> Church where there is not one real true Saint. Dare any Congregational Miniſter avouch the true grace of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Church? will any Church excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a perſon for want of true grace? Did the Apoſtles when they admitted members ſearch narrowly for the truth of grace?</p>
               <p n="5">5. I had almoſt ſaid, <hi>It is as great a fault to keep out viſible repenting believers willing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to all ordinances, as it is to tolerate wicked perſons in a Church.</hi> If the Presbyterial brethren are guilty of the latter, the Congregational are guilty of the former. I think it as great a faultto ſin againſt the <hi>lenity</hi> of Chriſt, as againſt the <hi>ſeverity</hi> of Chriſt. It is true, theſe wicked ones are a diſhonour to Chriſt, leaven to the lump, [but yet ſuſpended from the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi>] and they have not that means applied which might help to their ſouls ſalvation; but it is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170413:27"/>that which theſe Miniſters would gladly reach if they could, they alledge the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>their authority is for edification, not deſtruction.</hi> On the other ſide, to keep out thoſe who viſibly appear like Chriſtians, when men have power to take in, is to hinder theſe from being levened with true grace, a great offence to the godly, diſcouragement of ſouls, and Magiſterially to ſet up Rules which the Lord never appointed. Who blame Biſhops for ſetting up their poſts by God's poſts? I know the word <hi>viſible</hi> Believer is a contentious word, but I underſtand one plainly thus; Here is one that hath a competent knowledg of thoſe grounds which are eſſential to ſalvation, and believes them. His eſtate by nature he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth, and profeſſeth he believeth in the Lord Jeſus for life and ſalvation; his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation doth not confute his profeſſion; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips God in his family, and ſubjects to all Chriſt's Ordinances; [for the private confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Chriſtians and private faſtings, which ſometimes they have, though this were deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to have them frequent them, yet theſe [in ſuch a manner] being free-will offerings, I dare not tie up men to theſe, or elſe debar them] if he hath been ſcandalous, he declareth his repentance, cordially ſo far as charity can judge, and proves it by ſome time, would the Apoſtles have debarred ſuch a perſon from the Church? but [I ſpeak what I know] perſons who go thus far, and further, cannot yet be admitted to Church-fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>Some would have us go to <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.15. and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170413:27"/>
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2. to ſee the rules for Churches. What they have drawn from hence I know not; I have beſtowed ſo much pains in reading of men upon the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and find ſo little content in all that I read [great <hi>Hooker</hi> of <hi>N.E.</hi> would ſay, he would never forfeit his credit in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking thoſe Scriptures where he could not make Demonſtration] that now I regard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is ſaid upon it. One Text which I obſerved as I was reading through it in my courſe, gave me more ſettlement then all I had read. But alas good men, do they carry us to their <hi>Symbolical</hi> Divinity to prove what they would have? this will not prevail with judicious men. I think the Apoſtolical pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices muſt be our <hi>Reed</hi> to meaſure by; if you have precepts given where the qualification of perſons admitable to Church-fellowſhip are ſet down higher then I have ſet them down, I would be thankful if any one would ſhew me them. As for <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. I confeſs there is a <hi>golden</hi> Text, but I think they draw a <hi>leaden</hi> argument from it to our Church-fellowſhip. The fift Monarchy dreams have not as yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated us; that time is not yet come.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Parochial bounding of Churches doth not detract from the truth of Churches; it doth not hinder the <hi>purity,</hi> much leſs the <hi>entity</hi> of a Church.</p>
               <p>Vicinity of members is requiſite for mutual inſpection, convenient meeting for celebration of ordinances, but it adds nothing to the eſſence of a Church; particular Churches muſt be bounded ſomewhere.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:170413:28"/>
               <p>When the Law enjoyned men to keep their own pariſh Churches, it was but to prevent diſorder, that people ſhould be bound to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ordinarily at that place, and not run up and down where they liſted. If the Miniſter were godly the Law helped him, and it is likely that this hath turned as well to the good of that people, which elſe would not have ſo attended upon that Miniſtery which was pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and ſearching; if the Miniſter were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, it was but the denying of ſome outward accommodation in that pariſh, and ſo remove to a godly Miniſter. By vertue of the Law then every one did implicitely chooſe that Miniſter to be his where he came, which as I ſaid, was as well for the good as the hurt of people; if men had no mind to the Miniſter, they might chooſe whither they would go into that Pariſh or not: thoſe who were godly in the Pariſh, and had a good Miniſter, they were not offended at the Law: whence this Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial bounding ſhould be looked upon as ſuch an Antichriſtian buſineſs I cannot imagine.</p>
               <p>The chiefeſt inconveniency is by reaſon of the building of the place for Aſſembling in divers places upon the skirts of Towns; yet in <hi>N. E.</hi> perſons who live at farms three miles or more from the place of their Aſſembling in their own pariſh, go conſtantly to that place, when as they might joyn to another Church much neerer in another Town.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee what we ſhall do when Pariſh bounds are broken down: Vicinity is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, this is agreed upon by all, how then ſhall
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170413:28"/>we agree upon <hi>Vicinity?</hi> what will <hi>this</hi> Church call Vicinity? I doubt if there be a rich perſon who would joyn, and the Officer with mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have a mind to him, they will ſtretch <hi>vicinity</hi> very largely to fetch him in. Some of our brethren oppoſe Parochial boundings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo great, I doubt our brethren will not bring their Vicinity into a narrower compaſs; nay, we ſee how far they go for members: ſhould we go about to alter Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, I think few would be pleaſed in the manner of doing it, nor will agree upon Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity: wherefore I think we had better bear with ſome inconveniences, then while we ſeek to mend them create worſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In reducing of Churches to <hi>purity</hi> the Miniſter cannot do it alone; he muſt know the members impurity, it muſt be proved to him by witneſſes; let Churches be <hi>gathered,</hi> or whatever you call them, this muſt be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perſons can be excommunicated. But how do theſe members who find fault with Miniſters do this? One who came to his Miniſter and was very urgent to have him thus ſeclude wicked perſons from the Sacraments, when the Miniſter asked him whether he would come and bear witneſs againſt them, anſwered, <hi>ſo he might leave himſelf not worth a groat;</hi> but yet could ſeparate from his Miniſter: is this right? Theſe things premiſed, now to an Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Where there are the eſſential cauſes of a Church [matter and form] there is a true Church.</p>
               <p>But in many Parochial Congregations of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170413:29"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> there are the eſſential cauſes of a Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> many Parochial congregations in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are true Churches.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> deny who can. <hi>Poſitis cauſis eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentialibus ponitur effectus.</hi> For the <hi>Minor,</hi> I prove that thus.</p>
               <p>Where there are perſons ſound in the faith, and viſibly conformable to the rules of the Goſpel in their practice, there is the <hi>matter</hi> of a Church.</p>
               <p>Where theſe perſons doe conſent together to worſhip God in all his ordinances [Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> ſaith, <hi>all the ordinances ſo far as they know</hi>] with Officers duely qualified, and for ſubſtance orderly called, there is the <hi>form</hi> of a Church.</p>
               <p>But thus it is in many Parochial congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>matter</hi> I ſuppoſe we will not deny it, there are ſuch for viſible appearance as true as thoſe that are in congregational Churches. If it be asked, <hi>How many Pariſhes are there that have ſuch perſons, ſufficient in number to make a Church?</hi> That is none of my queſtion to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; but this I can ſay according to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns practice, who make <hi>eight</hi> [or fewer] to be ſufficient to the firſt founding of a Church; there will be divers Pariſhes found to have that number without queſtion.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>form,</hi> I have put in enough; the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting</hi> or <hi>conſenting,</hi> our brethren make the <hi>form:</hi> But I have put in the Officer, and ſo make it an <hi>Organical Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:170413:29"/>
               <p>For the Officer, if the quarrel be with his <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification,</hi> I think none dare deny but for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal graces, and Miniſterial abilities, there are abundance ſuch Miniſters in ſeveral Pariſhes.</p>
               <p>For their <hi>call,</hi> elected by the people, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by a Presbyterie very ſolemnly. If the Epiſcopal ordination be queſtioned, I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to it before [as alſo in my Book againſt the Separation] however I think there is as much cauſe to queſtion their ordination who are ordained by the people when Elders were preſent, or with others, <hi>onely praying</hi> after ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as there is to queſtion Ordination by a Biſhop and his Clergy. But what doe our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren cavilling againſt that, when they have <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi> which is the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the call, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves affirm? I think God hath witneſſed for them that they were true Miniſters, in going forth with them, and giving ſuch ſucceſſe to their Miniſtry, as I think our congregational brethren have not found ſince they came to queſtion and caſt off Epiſcopal Ordination [if any doe ſo.] I doubt if the congregational Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters had no more members of their Churches then they have converted ſince they have ſo much cried down Pariſhes and Epiſcopal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they would have very thin Churches. I doe not think the Lord did it <hi>therefore,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Epiſcopal Ordination; yet I think the Lords appearing ſo much in thoſe days over now he doth in converting-work, ſhould teach us much tenderneſs in theſe dayes, and not to walk ſo highly as ſome doe.</p>
               <p>If the objection be about the <hi>conſenting,</hi> the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170413:30"/>election of the people declare it <hi>explicitely,</hi> and their conſtant attendance upon ſuch a Miniſter in all the ordinances of God, declares their conſent <hi>implicitely.</hi> No Congregational Divine makes the <hi>form</hi> of a Church to conſiſt in the <hi>expliciteneſs</hi> of a <hi>covenant,</hi> but affirm that an <hi>implicite covenant</hi> preſerves the true nature of the Church. So Mr. <hi>Hooker Sur. Ch. Diſ. part.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 47, 48. So Mr. <hi>Norton Reſp. ad Apol. p.</hi> 22, 28. So the <hi>Synod of New-England, Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>S.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If there be as much for ſubſtance in many Parochial congregations as there was in <hi>Corinth,</hi> to make it a true Church, then many Parochial congregations are true Churches.</p>
               <p>But the Antecedent is true; <hi>Ergo</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent is true.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Conſequence</hi> is clear; for the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was a true Church I hope. For the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> 1. It's true, we have not many preaching officers in one Pariſh, as had that Church [which I conceive did not all meet in the ſame place for Church-worſhip, but in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.] 2. Nor have we <hi>extraordinary Prophets,</hi> as were in that Church [though our brethren ſtrangely make thoſe a proof for their private members <hi>Propheſying</hi> [as they call it] yea and are ſo highly carried in their notions, that if their Paſtor be abſent, though there be another Miniſter preach in the Town, they will not go to hear him, but a Tradeſman muſt Propheſie [what this implies who ſeeth not] if a Paſtor be dead, and the people goe to another congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the Paſtor whereof is of their own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170413:30"/>theſe have been charged by one of our <hi>Eſſex</hi> Independent Miniſters with <hi>irregular walking,</hi> for not ſtaying at home and Propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing [a ſin certainly againſt the <hi>eleventh</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.] 3. Nor have we other extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts, as that Church had. 4. Nor have we men ordained by the Apoſtles. 5. Nor called by the Apoſtles; for if theſe things doe weaken my argument, then they doe as well cut off the congregational Churches to be true Churches.</p>
               <p>But if the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had perſons cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Word, ſome whereof were <hi>real</hi> Saints, and ſome onely viſible; ſo have we. If they had perſons Officers, who held out the faith of the Goſpel in their teaching ſoundly; ſo have we, as ſound as they did or could doe, if not ſounder, ſuch as build not hay nor ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp;c. If they had the Ordinances of Chriſt; ſo have we. If they conſented to worſhip God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo doe ours. Theſe are the Eſſentials of that Church. <hi>The Eſſence is perpetually the ſame,</hi> but <hi>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170413:31"/>none to overtop them, and yet were negligent. How to get their Churches purer the Miniſtry find it hard; to excommunicate a multitude our congregational brethren ſay, <hi>no;</hi> to ſeparate from the reſt our claſſical brethren are not clear, they quote the Text, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Their authority is given for edification, not deſtruction.</hi> They muſt doe what they can by degrees, which they are reſolved upon, and deſerve to be encouraged by all.</p>
               <p>More Arguments I could give [<hi>as from the nullity of all the Ordinances which elſe muſt follow.</hi> Alſo, <hi>I wonder whether our congregational Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were converted in Parochial, or congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches.</hi>] But I forbear.</p>
               <p>Hence then that congregational brethren may aſſociate with the claſſical, to me there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, though my practice is ſomething different from the claſſical brethren; yet what they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is ſo candid, that I am rather thankful to them that they are ſo willing to aſſociate with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That we way hold communion with a Church ſo far as we are intangled in no ſin,</hi> I think was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver denied; but ſo may we with the claſſical bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: For what though they baptize all, and all of them do not [though ſome do, and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it] bring their people to an explicite engagement; yet they deſire us not to have communion with <hi>all</hi> their members, but with their <hi>compleat members,</hi> i. e. thoſe whom they admit to all Ordinances; and I am ſure thoſe, according to the rules drawn up, would have gone for good Church-members in the Apoſtles
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170413:31"/>days, and, I think, ſhould now; ſo that we are called to aſſociate onely with thoſe who are as good members as our own.</p>
               <p>As for their Baptizing of the Infants of ſuch whom they debar from the Lords table; though their arguments doe not convince men [no not good Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> that man who now I hear is with God; if he had, I would have poofeſſed it to the world. I doe more admire to ſee what anſwers ſo learned a man gives; but that I have profeſſed in my <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader</hi> that I would meddle no more with the queſtion, I find it very eaſie to take off [at leaſt in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion] what he hath ſaid, had but he caſt the <hi>major</hi> propoſition in p. 97. thus [which he knew was my Scope.] <hi>Such as for manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs</hi> de jure <hi>ought, and</hi> de facto <hi>are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd from the Lords Table,</hi> &amp;c.
<note place="margin">To this I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> Then ſee how his anſwer from Infants takes me off; but I ſhall adde no more. Now though he hath not ſatisfied me] yet I look on the Arguments as more valid to prove the Infants of thoſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perſons ſhould be baptized, then are their arguments who caſt out the Infants of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and believing parents from Baptiſm and the Church; yet theſe our congregational brethren make no ſcruple to communicate with, and to have ſuch members in their Churches.</p>
               <p>Are all the members of congregational Churches ſuch as they ought to be viſibly? I doubt it. Some are as offenſive as many in Parochial Churches. Should we therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe communion one with another becauſe of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170413:32"/>ſuch? Would <hi>Paul</hi> have done it at <hi>Corinth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for taking members out of other Pariſhes,</hi> which our brethren ſtand upon ſo ſtiffely, and without which there will be no Aſſociation, this hath been the old breaking principle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved it ſeems they are to hold it.</p>
               <p>In what caſes, and upon what conditions it ſhall be allowed, our claſſical brethren have declared, and I think ſufficiently to give a heart that loves peace, ſatisfaction. For my own part I care not if the thing be yielded; I think I might make as good a ſhift as another, and have had tentations ſtrong this way: but I did never yet take up ſuch a practice, not out of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to the Pariſh bounds, but becauſe I have to be that unworthy principle which hath chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindled the fire in this poor Church. Should I have done it, becauſe I looked on my way more pure then my neighbour-Miniſters? I knew the impurity of my own heart, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on my Neighbour-Miniſter as more godly; if I ſhould think more highly of my own parts, I knew my own weakneſſe, and might juſtly fear leſt God ſhould blaſt the little I had. But</p>
               <p n="1">1. I hope our brethren doe not think it a ſin for a Miniſter to keep to his own Pariſh, if they doe, let us hear them prove it. I have heard it reported by a very ſerious Chriſtian, that one of our brethren ſhould affirm that <hi>Chriſtians were bound to come out of their Parochial wayes, and to joyn in Church-fellowſhip after the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating manner, elſe they did partake of the mark of the Beaſt.</hi> I write it as well as I can remember it, but becauſe I heard it not with my own ears,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170413:32"/>firſt I doe not ſo fully believe the truth of it; yet there are good reaſons why I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it: I had ſomething to ſay, but at preſent let it alone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I am ſure <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.12. Is not this a rule for us? grant the thing to be <hi>lawful,</hi> that is, it might be done without any breach of Gods Law [though not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to doe it] yet I am ſure it is not <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi> for us to doe it, becauſe we ſee it is that which hath broken and doth break the peace of our Churches; but the peace of Churches ought to be very precious to us. If <hi>we be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to follow peace with all men,</hi> then I hope to follow after, and endeavour the peace of the Churches, is a duty of great weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this is looked upon as the Miniſters weakneſs, that this ſhould break peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Be it ſo that it is their weakneſſe, then let others ſhew their <hi>ſtrength</hi> in bearing with their weakneſſe, ſince they have no command to take people from other good Miniſters. <hi>Thoſe who are ſtrong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But I doubt there is <hi>ſtrong</hi> reaſon for this <hi>weakneſſe.</hi> For 1. This grieves the heart of a godly brother, to have thoſe in whom lies his chiefeſt comfort taken from him; if you take away my comfort, there is reaſon why I ſhould be grieved: would you not have a godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be a comfort to the Miniſter?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It weakens the hands of that good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in endeavours to reform. Who will ſtand
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170413:33"/>by him if the godly be gone from him? Thoſe commonly who are taken out of other Pariſhes are not of the pooreſt ſort.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When a place hath wanted a Miniſter, it hath been a cauſe of ſuch diſcouragement to godly Miniſters, that a godly man will not readily come into ſuch a Pariſh, becauſe the congregational men have taken out the good people, or ſome of them, it may be the chief out of the Pariſh, and ſo the Pariſh lie deſtitute of a Miniſter a long time, and at laſt muſt get ſuch as they can; and thus the ſouls of others are endangered. As for their returning of ſuch to that Miniſter in caſe he will come, we know their judgment by their practiſes. When Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes have had good Miniſters, this hath helped to remove them. That practice then which ſo diſcourageth good Miniſters, as it cauſeth their removal, and hinders others from coming into place, I doe not look at this as a light matter, but a <hi>practice intolerable</hi> in the Churches. Though this be not ſo bad as is the practice of ſome by me, yet in effect it comes to the ſame. Two ſmall Pariſhes lying ſo as they may eaſily joyn, and would; but thoſe in them who had a ſhew of Religion turn'd to the Separation, whence no godly Miniſter cares for coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, but there the people lie year after year, no Miniſter to regard them, no Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: who knowes what God might have done for the ſouls of ſome of them, had the profeſſing party held cloſe, and encouraged a godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to come amongſt them, whereas now for divers years they have had none, nor are like
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170413:33"/>to have. This practice of our brethren comes to the ſame in concluſion, if they thus take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the good people out of other Pariſhes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What weakneſſe ſoever this is in them, I doubt our <hi>ſtrong</hi> men would not take it well, to have another come and take away their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from them. Something I heard <hi>hiſce auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> what one ſaid when a Miniſter would have come into another Pariſh by, and took away ſome of his people. Thoſe who are eminent in parts, and have their people ſure to them, may ſay <hi>Let them goe;</hi> but what they would doe if the thing ſhould be practiſed, I know not: But however 'tis good to weigh things in the ſcales of reaſon; and if ſo, I think it a juſt matter of grief, and ſo of offence to good Miniſters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their free conſent to take away any of their people. So much for <hi>weakneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The congregational brethren being leſſe in number by ten, if not twenty parts, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the number of other Miniſters, and thoſe godly, one would think it ſhould be a mercy ſufficient that they live in ſuch a Nation as this <hi>quietly;</hi> having the <hi>freedome of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, let them reform what they can in their own places.</hi> The Magiſtrate doth countenance the Miniſters, though of different judgments, and ſo numerous, yet willing to aſſociate, and ſhew brotherly communion. For my part, I look on it as a great mercy [had I a heart to anſwer it] though I doe not goe and fleet the cream of my neighbours congregations becauſe they are not of my judgment.</p>
               <p>This is ſpoken in reference to our Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170413:34"/>which if it were but yielded, there were hopes of cloſure: Nor do I ſee any reaſon why our brethren ſhould ſo much ſtand upon it; for I think their gathering of one Church out of divers true Churches is almoſt at an end; for thoſe who have a mind to ſeparate, affect <hi>no</hi> Churches rather then Congregational Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>As for ſuch to whom the brethren have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Agreement for peace, and they refuſe to aſſociate with their brethren without any Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural reaſon given why they ſo refuſe [a great care having been taken of croſſing of mens prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which were not plainly againſt Scripture, and might ſtand with peace and ſobriety] but rather affect to ſtand alone: if any in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes ſhall deſire to joyn with any of the Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated Churches, I know no reaſon why our hands ſhould be ſo bound up that we ſhould not receive them; but others muſt take from us, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if they be ſuch who have a right to the Lords Supper, but did not, nor will communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with ſuch a congregation, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that of them which the Word doth not, before they will admit them. This I conceive were great bondage, that a Miniſter with three or four men ſhall ſet up a way of admiſſion to the Lords Supper, which all muſt come to; the thing it ſelf may be good, but not required to a Church-ſtate, nor the receiving of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and that all muſt ſtoop to this, or have no Supper there; and becauſe of Parochial bounds they muſt have it no where elſe. Men may be of different judgments from mine, but that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170413:34"/>ſhall never hinder communion, if they be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe qualified, and yield but to what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to a Church-ſtate, in which men, though of different perſwaſions other wayes, yet all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, be they Epiſcopal, Claſſical, or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational, unleſſe ſome of theſe laſt make an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite</hi> covenant the <hi>form</hi> of the Church, which I ſee ſome of our brethren do here in <hi>England:</hi> Elſe what means that paſſage of a brother, <hi>But it will by us be expected</hi> [ſatis pro imperio] <hi>that you leave the brethren and godly</hi> (yet ungather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>free who have voluntarily come under no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement</hi> explicitely <hi>with your Pariſh ways ſince the fall of Prelacie.</hi> I could quote another who carries it more cloſely. Then it ſeems all thoſe Chriſtians who before this walked with their godly Paſtors in conſtant attendance upon, and ſubjection to all Ordinances, muſt now come under an explicite covenant, or what?</p>
               <p>For my part, I ſaid before, it was not any conſcience to Pariſh bounds which hath kept me from receiving of perſons from other Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, but deſire of peace: But if men will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe terms of peace ſo drawn up with ſo much tenderneſs, as I think can well be deſired, I ſhall receive thoſe who ſhall deſire to joyn with me, and reſign them up again when there comes a man who will embrace peace with his brethren: I do not look upon our rules binding me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then our Aſſociations.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This ſome of our congregational brethren look upon, as <hi>cutting off congregational liberty by the middle.</hi> But I conceive not ſo, they put in the words <hi>Conveniencie</hi> and <hi>Edification;</hi> nor is their intent [ſo far as I apprehend] to null the power of particular Churches, but onely to be aſſiſtant to each other in the wiſe mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of ſo great an Ordinance: and <hi>Bleſſed be God</hi> [ſay I.] <hi>that ſuch Aſſiſtance may be had.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Church-Diſcipline is an Inſtitution of Chriſt, I doe not at all queſtion. That the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off a member from a Church is a thing of great weight, I do not alſo queſtion. [Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, though able, when they come to the Amputation of a natural member, love to call in all the help they can.] And as certain I am that through the abuſe and ill maniging of this Solemn Ordinance, it hath almoſt loſt its glory. This hath not been the fault of the Pope and the Hierarchy; but I wiſh I could ſay that ſome
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170413:35"/>congregational Churches had not expoſed it to contempt through their indiſcreet carriages in this Ordinance; I know of more then two or three of theſe Churches in which this fault will be found. In <hi>Ipſwich</hi> in <hi>N. E.</hi> where thoſe two worthy men Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Rogers</hi> [Paſtor] and Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> [Teacher] had the managing of this Ordinance, they carried on the work with ſo much <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> [the cauſe did permit it] before they came to the execution of it, and with ſo much Majeſty and Terrour when they came to the Sentence, that the hearts of all the members [I think] were ſtruck with fear, and many eyes could not but let drop tears; the Ordinance had ſomething of the majeſty of the Ordainer in it. If we could carry on this Ordinance thus, we might recover the glory of it.</p>
               <p>What particular Churches may do when no Aſſiſtance can be had, is one thing; what they ought to doe when it may be had, is another. Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> is a man who favours particular Churches enough, yet ſaith,

               <p>Furthermore, becauſe the brethren ſtand ſo much upon the power of particular Churches, I deſire [as I have divers years profeſſed my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170413:36"/>ſatisfaction in this point] they would pleaſe to clear it from the <hi>N. T.</hi> where they find ſuch particular Churches as ours are in theſe ſmall Villages, conſiſting of one Paſtor, and a few members, being ſo near to other Churches as ours are, and might unite if they would; yet that ſuch particular Churches kept themſelves diſtinct, and exerciſed all power within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without any dependance upon, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation with other Churches. If Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examples be any thing to us, I think they will not prove it. I could never yet underſtand the reaſon of this conſequence. <hi>The Churches in Jeruſalem, in Rome, in Corinth, in Epheſus,</hi> &amp;c. were independent for the execution of their power; <hi>Ergo,</hi> every particular Church in a ſmall Village with one Paſtor, and a few mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is independent for the execution of all Church-power.</p>
               <p>I pray let us conſider whether it will not more anſwer the Scripture-patterns, to have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of our ſmaller Villages to unite, and make up but <hi>One Church,</hi> though every Miniſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his ſtation, taking care eſpecially [though not <hi>onely]</hi> of thoſe who live within his own Pariſh, and to preach to theſe, adminiſter Sacraments, exhort, rebuke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he findeth cauſe. But yet as to the exerciſe of <hi>all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power,</hi> they are but <hi>One Church.</hi> I dare ſay it will come neerer to the Scripture, then doth the practice of the Churches as now they ſtand. Our brethren yield the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be but <hi>One Church;</hi> but that this Church met alwaies for all Ordinances in one place, who
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170413:36"/>can imagine? Though the Apoſtles went up to the Temple to Preach, yet that was as well for the ſake of others who came to the Temple, and not yet converted; the Apoſtles went to meet with <hi>them,</hi> they did not goe to meet with the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> But we doe not read that they went thither to adminiſter the Lords Supper. Where they could find a room for five thouſand perſons to receive the Supper together, I cannot tell; to throw away ones reaſon in matters of practice is hard: what a long time muſt they be adminiſtring? though others did help, yet they muſt have room to paſſe to and fro to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the elements, that at laſt we muſt have a vaſt place.</p>
               <p>Moſt Divines that I read agree, that by <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread, Acts</hi> 2.42. is meant the Lords Supper: I doe not ſee that <hi>Beza</hi> hath many followers. Why then by <hi>breaking of bread,</hi> v. 46. ſhould not be meant the Lords Supper alſo, and their <hi>eating meat with gladneſs</hi> their <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſts</hi> which attended the Supper, I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though I know many Divines doe not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it as in 42.</p>
               <p>That it is the phraſe whereby the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is ſet forth in the New Teſtament, is yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. &amp; <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. and ſo in the 42. <hi>v.</hi> of this <hi>Chap.</hi> Once in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.30, 35. we find it meant of an ordinary ſupper, the text doth clear it, though ſome Papiſts would draw it to the Sacrament under one element, yet other Papiſts deny it here.</p>
               <p>It's true, we find this phraſe once in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.7. to be underſtood of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170413:37"/>giving of Alms to the poor; but there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between theſe phraſes, <hi>Breaking bread to the hungry,</hi> and this <hi>Breaking bread:</hi> we doe not find the words <hi>to the hungry,</hi> or ſuch like, added in the New Teſtament. If this be yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then they did <hi>break bread Domatim,</hi> as <hi>Beza.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Corn. a Lap.</hi> thus interprets the Text of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and ſaith that doth not hinder that they did break <hi>Domatim, quia cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoute numero fidelium, per varias domos eos diſtribuere, in iiſque Euchariſtiam celebrare oportebat.</hi> In this ſenſe alſo <hi>Chemnitius</hi> takes the words,

Thus I doubt not but it was in <hi>Rome, Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> where were many Officers, and much people, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.10. They met in ſeveral places for Preaching and Sacraments; yet theſe were but one Church. That Text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. ſeems to carry it fairly: There were divers of theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in <hi>Corinth</hi> which he calls Churches;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170413:37"/>and yet in another ſenſe it is the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> As for the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, how <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> and others interpret them is well known, with whom agree the <hi>Arab.</hi> Verſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.44. ſo that I ſay no more to them.</p>
               <p>Now if theſe did thus meet as before, why may not we as well meet in our ſeveral Pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and yet be but one Church, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Elders in common to that One Church? ſo may we have divers Elders in One Church, as had theſe Churches. Our Pariſhes lie ſo, that thoſe who dwell in the next Pariſhes are as well known to Miniſters as many of their own; they dwell much neerer to places of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling for the worſhip of God, then doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in our own Pariſhes; and for number, we may joyn divers of our Pariſhes together before we ſhall have ſo many compleat members to all Ordinances as were in <hi>Jeruſalem, Rome,</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> Such a Church as this I could willingly call (in one ſenſe) an <hi>Independent Church.</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> (a congregational Divine) was once very near this opinion in his <hi>Country Eſſay for the practice of Church-government.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 59.</note> He would have the extreams of the Diviſion not be above 8, or 10 miles, ſo the center not more then 4, or 5 miles from any part of it, &amp;c. though in ſome things we ſhall differ, yet not in what I aim at. For ought I can ſee this would come neereſt to Scripture, and for the benefits of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If any Miniſter die, here are Miniſters ſtill left in the ſame Church to ordain another in his room [the people electing] and to try him before election.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:170413:38"/>2. The matters of Juriſdiction are carried on with the counſel and aſſiſtance of divers; where is hoped to be more ſafety, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Excommunication more ſolemn.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any Miniſter be ſcandalous, here is a way for his Excommunication. Things now may be carried on as they were in thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which we finde in the New Teſtament, where there were many Elders; and divers queſtions which have troubled the Churches, about <hi>the peoples ordaining of a Miniſter, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of their Miniſter,</hi> &amp;c. avoided. And thus our brethrens trouble about <hi>Pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds</hi> is alſo avoided in great part. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt difficulty I find is this, that we are divided about the qualification, of Church-members, which they in <hi>Jeruſalem, Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. were not. Certainly there <hi>were</hi> and <hi>are</hi> common rules for all Churches to goe by, or elſe they could not have agreed more then we. If the Lord had left it to the liberty of every Miniſter to require what qualifications he pleaſed, then confuſion and diviſion muſt neceſſarily have been always in the Church. Is it ſo hard then to find out theſe Rules? Were we to Preach to Heathen, and they underſtanding the doctrines of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did profeſſe their aſſents unto thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, their conſent to take Chriſt for their Saviour and Lord, their ſorrow <hi>for</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing <hi>of</hi> their former wicked ways, giving up themſelves to Chriſt, his ways and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſurely ſuch as theſe we muſt admit and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize; if not, give us a Text where the Apoſtles refuſed ſuch. If after Baptiſm they viſibly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170413:38"/>their profeſſion then made, they were continued members, and had fellowſhip in all Church-priviledges, I think ſo. Let us come thus far, and we ſhall agree for many; thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us who apparently bely the profeſſion made at Baptiſm, let them either be brought to repentance, or ſecluded. [That is my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I think all <hi>would</hi> have it ſo, who would reform the Church.]</p>
               <p n="2">2. However the congregational brethren, who doe agree in qualifications, and dwell thus neer, may unite into one Church; and ſo may others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Since our brethren who look on all their Pariſhes as Church-members, doe not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us ſo to judge of them, and deſire us onely to Aſſociate with them in giving commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to ſuch as are qualified according as they have ſet down [the qualifications certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrict enough for Church-members, if not too ſtrict, if we goe to the rigour of them, ſo as congregational Churches will not anſwer in all points] why may we not unite with them ſo far? Theſe things I propound willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome light; but as to what the Claſſical brethren require, it is no more then <hi>N. E.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines doe allow and practice in their Councils. Certainly ſince we know our ſelves to be men ſubject to infirmities, corruptions, tentations, many, if not moſt now unacquainted with the exerciſe of Church-Diſcipline, a weighty Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, the glory of it almoſt loſt, one would think no Chriſtian Miniſter ſhould deſire to ſtand alone, but be moſt willing to take in all
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170413:39"/>aſſiſtance he could, and not eſteem it a needleſs troubling of himſelf [as ſay ſome of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren] but rather a mercie that he may have help from his neighbouring Miniſters.</p>
               <p>If any man will go further with me, and ſay, if you will mould your Churches according to thoſe in the Scripture, and have divers Elders to carry on the Affaires of the Church, why then may we not have one Elder among theſe, who may be a <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I anſwer. If you doe not make this <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>primus Presbyter, ſtanding Moderator</hi> [or what other name you will give him] a diſtinct Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural Officer from other Presbyters, giving to him a power diſtinct <hi>from</hi> and ſuperiour <hi>to</hi> the power of other Preaching Presbyters, whence he ſhall perform ſome Church-Acts which other preaching Presbyters <hi>ſhall not</hi> or <hi>cannot</hi> perform, ſo that it be no diſtinct or ſuperiour power, but onely <hi>order</hi> which is contended for, I am well content to yield it, being ready to goe with others for peace and unities ſake, till they come to conſtitute Officers which Chriſt never did, then I ſay <hi>Hold.</hi> But for a <hi>ſtanding Moderator,</hi> one that <hi>Durante vitâ modo bene ſe geſſerit,</hi> ſhall keep that place, let him, <hi>per me licet.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the meetings of Councils there muſt be one who muſt rule and order the affairs at thoſe times; a Preſident, a Moderator muſt be, reaſon leads us to it to avoid confuſion: and this is ſeen in the ſynodical meetings of Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Elders.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:170413:39"/>2. He who is choſen Preſident or Moderator this Seſſion may be the next, and the next; we may chooſe him for one year, or two years, what Scripture text forbids it? why may we not twenty?</p>
               <p n="3">3. I am ſo far from thinking it is contrary to Scripture, that I think it comes neereſt to Scripture. [I may declare my opinion with ſubmiſſion to better judgements] for as for the word <hi>Angel</hi> mentioned in the Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches, though I cannot agree to that which that ever honoured and learned <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> doth gather from it, namely,
<note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For what <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſaith of created Angels, <hi>Angelus eſt nomen officii non naturae, ſemper ſunt ſpiritus ſed cum</hi> mittuntur <hi>vocantur Angeli,</hi> I may apply to this, if all true preaching Miniſters are <hi>ſent,</hi> as they are, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. then they alſo are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. I think our Divines have ſpoken ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to take off this; yet [with favour] I conceive that Chriſt mentioning an <hi>Angel</hi> in the ſingular number, and reaſon telling us what muſt be in all orderly Meetings &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils to avoid confuſion, there being divers Elders in one Church, who had the care, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and government of it; I conceive thoſe Elders had one who for order ſake was a Preſident, Moderator, [though he had not <hi>power</hi> above them, as may be proved by other Scriptures] that ordered the tranſactions when they met; nor can I conceive it was ſo,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170413:40"/>for one Seſſion or two, but for his life for ought I can learn, he that can, let him prove the contrary? in that he is taken notice of ſo in a ſpecial manner, it ſhould ſeem he was one that was ſo more then one or two Seſſions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I verily conceive that error [be not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I pray, if I call it ſo, for I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be ſo] which ſo ſoon crept in, of <hi>one</hi> aſſuming power above other Presbyters, took its firſt riſe upon <hi>occaſion</hi> of this Order. God's providence ſo ordering it to leave his own Servants to their wiſedom and wills, who freely acting made way at laſt for his Decrees: for if the Preſident or Moderator had ſhifted and changed every Seſſion, I cannot tell which way it was poſſible a Pope ſhould have riſen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Therefore away with your <hi>ſtanding Moderator,</hi> you have ſpoken enough againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Stay, not too faſt; muſt I throw away every thing that may be or is abuſed? <hi>occaſio</hi> and <hi>cauſa</hi> differ much. <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> and ſo other Miniſters may abuſe their power; ſhall then a Miniſter have no power over his people? <hi>Tollatur abuſus, maneat uſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But for Miniſters power we have Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for it plainly, ſo we have not for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtanding Moderator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> By Scripture Authority we make Officers, who have power from Chriſt immediately. I am not diſcourſing of the making of a <hi>Church-Officer,</hi> and what <hi>power</hi> ſuch an Officer ſhould have, I diſclaim this; <hi>power</hi> and <hi>order</hi> are two things.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:170413:40"/>2. That Text which before I produced, I know not what fairer Interpretation can be given of it. I can exclude ſuperiority of power by other Scriptures, but why an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture which croſſes no other Scripture, nor ſound reaſon, and hath ſuch fair probability from the practiſe of the moſt ancient, ſhould not be admitted [eſpecially when a fairer Interpretation cannot be given [for my part I know none] I know no reaſon.</p>
               <p>The moſt that can be objected againſt me is matter of <hi>Prudence.</hi> But I conceive 1. that which comes neereſt to make peace in the Church, and doth not croſs the Scripture, that is prudence. 2. That which comes neereſt to Scripture Interpretation, having the practice of ſo many ancient holy Men and Martyrs [though I know they went higher] to give light to it, this I call prudence. 3. Time will diſcover which will have moſt prudence in it, whether a Moderator or Preſident changed every Seſſion, or a ſtanding Moderator. I think now we are out of danger of making a Pope, if his time of ruine be ſo neer as ſome think.</p>
               <p>Thus I have delivered my thoughts, humbly conceiving that a Church ſo moulded as there may be divers elders in it, and amongſt theſe one choſen for a <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170413:41"/>power, being independent, as was the Church in <hi>Epheſus.</hi> But to have one Paſtor, and it may be twelve men to ſtand alone, and to exerciſe all Church-power when they may aſſociate, I deſire to ſee ſuch a Church in Scripture.</p>

We blame the <hi>Socinians</hi> becauſe they adhere not to Divine Teſtimony, but will try all things at the bar of their reaſon, and ſo approve or diſapprove: and are they blameleſs, who <hi>when they have Divine Teſtimony</hi> and reaſon alſo for two things, yet they will call this but an Adjunct, (when as that Adjunct hath more and clearer Scriptures for to prove it) and the other an eſſential cauſe (which hath fewer Scriptures, and thoſe not ſo clear to ſpeak for it) and ſo neglect the Adjunct? what are theſe notions to our practiſe? to which God's <hi>Adjuncts</hi> (if you call them ſo) are <hi>eſſential.</hi>

               <p>A few words then for Ordination (my chief aim being at <hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> in Ordination, and ſo I will make the more haſte over this.)</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Whether gifts and popular election be ſufficient to conſtitute a Miniſter without Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where, firſt, by a Miniſter I underſtand not one who exerciſeth for the trial of his gifts, before he be ordained; for if <hi>Timothy</hi> muſt <hi>commit the things, &amp;c. to faithful men,

But by a Miniſter I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand one who doth Officially and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively Preach, adminiſter Sacraments, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Church, ordain others, (though the latter ſeems to be a begging of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.)</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp;c. (who makes Ordination not eſſential to the call of a Miniſter) hath commented upon it. <hi>The ſending which the Apoſtle means is not a Miniſterial or Eccleſiaſtical ſending, but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170413:43"/>ſending by giving men gifts, and working with them in their uſe and exerciſe.</hi> He gives reaſons, of which afterwards.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then it ſeems Eccleſiaſtical ſending is not providential ſending. Hath God no act of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the ſending of a Miniſter, when he is ſent by Miniſters? I thought providential ſending (as the more general) had compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under it Miniſterial ſending, but this Author oppoſeth them <hi>not this</hi> but <hi>that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I thought God's preſence working with men in the exerciſe of their gifts, let them be ſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially or eccleſiaſtially had been a diſtinct thing from his ſending them; that to <hi>ſend</hi> is one thing, and to work with a perſon <hi>ſent</hi> is another. So to give <hi>gifts</hi> is one thing, but to <hi>ſend</hi> a gifted man another: if not, but <hi>gifting</hi> be <hi>ſending,</hi> then Election is as needleſs as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; for why? I am ſent providentially becauſe I am gifted: but that Author is ſtiff for popular Election.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But what if God doth not pleaſe to work in the exerciſe of gifts to breed faith? are not therefore ſuch perſons ſent? it muſt not be ſo by this Interpretation. The Prophets of God did little or no good that we read of, yet 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15. God ſaith <hi>he ſent</hi> them: till they found the Lord working they were not fent. It's poſſible they might preach half a year or more before they did convert one; it ſeems all that time they were not <hi>ſent</hi> becauſe God did not work with their gifts. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. the Prophet had a commiſſion not to breed faith, yet <hi>ſent;</hi> this will trouble ſome good Miniſters.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170413:43"/>Some mens gifts lie more in building up then in bringing home, are they not therefore ſent?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then it ſeems if God make me an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to beget faith in any, I muſt not look at it as the fruit of God's ſending me Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally (as he hath appointed Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the gathering and building up his Church) but only as I was ſent providentially, and ſo have no comfort <hi>quatenus</hi> an Officer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Doth God's ſending by giving gifts, and Miniſterial ſending oppoſe each other? in one ſenſe indeed he may make <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi> oppoſites, for they do <hi>differre re &amp; ratione:</hi> but if he conſider them in their affection to a Miniſter, they are eſſential cauſes conſtituting the ſame effect, the Miniſterial fending follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's gifting.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The great ſtanding Ordinance which God hath appointed to breed faith inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, is the Miniſtry <hi>Eccleſiaſtically</hi> fent: and I think <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. will prove it; though God hath not tied up himſelf ſo as to uſe no other means, but this is his common way.

I have heard of ſome perſons who were adult, that could neither hear nor ſpeak, yet ſo far as in charity we might judge by ſome of their outward geſtures in reference to holy things, they might have

Divers inſtances might be given which would make as much againſt providential ſending by gifts, as Eccleſiaſtical ſending.</p>

               <p n="4">4. I cannot yet be convinced, but that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is an act of authoritative power; but commending of a perſon to God in prayer is no act of ſuch power.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Scripture gives us another definition of Ordination, as I ſhall ſhew afterwards, <hi>ergo</hi> this is not the true definition.</p>
               <p>Thus then I have made it clear, that gifts and popular election are not ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a Miniſter, (if the Scripture may be judge) we may make uſe of other civil officers
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170413:48"/>to illuſtrate it more.

               <p>There is much reaſon why the popular ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould give the eſſence here, but there is no ſuch reaſon why it ſhould to a Miniſter; yet here we find in civil officers more then election before they can act. I pray let us have order in the Church as well.</p>
               <p>This being diſpatched, now it will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow that Ordination is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the conſtitution of a Miniſter, though I ſhould ſay no more: it is but little I intend to ſay, (or need to ſay) for the reaſon I gave before.</p>

               <p>The <hi>major,</hi> if any deny, they muſt take away the authority of the Scriptures, leave men to their own phantaſies, which no holy man ever dare ſay, ſo that I doubt not but that will ſtand. The <hi>minor,</hi> if any deny, it muſt be upon one of theſe two grounds. 1. Either denying that we have any poſitive <hi>rules,</hi> becauſe we have none but examples, which ſhews how Miniſters came in to office. But if thoſe examples of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170413:49"/>Apoſtles commiſſioned by Chriſt to order his houſe, having ſuch a promiſe of his preſence with them, be not rules to us, then we have no rules at all left for officers coming into his houſe, which were ſtrange defect of wiſedom to impute to Chriſt, that he ſhould have a houſe and no order in it; and contrary to the old Church, which had rules exactly for their officers coming in. Nor muſt popular election be ever more pleaded for. Or</p>
               <p n="2">2. They muſt deny it, becauſe officers were made without any ordination, which is the thing. I deſire to ſee proved from Scripture. If we obſerve the practiſe of the Apoſtles after they had received the promiſe of the Spirit, and were now fitted and ſent forth to act with that Spirit guiding them, we find that thus they did ſet Deacons in the houſe of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6.</p>

As the Church-Members conſiſt of bodies as well as ſouls, which bodies muſt be provided for by others if they have not of their own to uphold them; and ſince God hath given in charge that collections ſhould be made for the poor. Since alſo there are divers things which belong to the worſhip of God, and things about the Church, which muſt have money to buy them, and to anſwer for them; hence it ſtands with right reaſon that an Officer be choſen and authorized to be the Church-Treaſurer, to take in theſe collections and moneys, and by theſe to ſerve the poors Table, the Lord's Table, (I conceive they had their Love-feaſts at that time alſo) and why they ſhould not attend upon the Miniſter at the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord's Supper I know not.

               <p>For my part I am loth to engage further then I have clear Scripture to back me, or neceſſary conſequence from it. If we take Ordination at large, as this Scripture holds it out, and other agree with it, it may be thus deſcribed. <hi>Ordination is the ſeparation of a perſon called to the work of the Miniſtry, by perſons in office with faſting, prayer, and Impoſition of hands:</hi> Thus far this Text will warrant us; and it is the fulleſt that any one Text will afford us. Let us ſee how this ſutes with other Scriptures. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Romans,</hi> he was <hi>called to be an Apoſtle, ſeparated unto the Goſpel of God.</hi> Here is my Authority, I do not run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was ſent. But when was this done? and how this done? look to my Text, and I doubt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170413:51"/>not but theſe Texts anſwer each to other. <hi>Separate me Paul and Barnabas for the worke whereunto I have called them, v.</hi> 2. I have <hi>called,</hi> do you then <hi>ſeparate:</hi> both the words we find here. It ſeems they were not to ſeek what it was to <hi>ſeparate,</hi> how to go about it, they had been acquainted with that work before. This phraſe <hi>ſeparate</hi> is the old phraſe the Lord uſed before in his ordaining of old Officers. <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Thus ſhalt thou ſeparate the Levites, &amp;c.</hi> thus, how? among other things; <hi>The children of Iſrael ſhall put their hands upon the Levites.</hi> It was ſo here with <hi>Paul.</hi> So <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.8. <hi>At that time the Lord ſeparated the Tribe of Levi.</hi> So <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.9. a full place. The Lord ſeparated <hi>Iſrael</hi> from other Nations, this was a high favour; but in <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Lord made another ſeparation, and this was higher honour ſtill. <hi>Seemeth it but a ſmall thing unto you that the God of Iſrael hath ſeparated you, &amp;c.</hi> Thus we ſee the Lord keeps the old phraſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Some I ſuppoſe make it the whole eſſence, their Acts declare it, they do nothing elſe (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs preach) and others look on impoſition of hands but as a common thing among the Jews, when they would wiſh one well, or pray for them, or bleſs them after their manner, they laid their hands on their heads, and ſo impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is now laid aſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> But ſtay a little, 1. Are you certain that theſe prayed while they impoſed hands in ordination? I do not ſee how you will force it out of the Text: nor can you force it from <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6. the word is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="4">4. If you ask me <hi>what is then?</hi> truly I find it hard to anſwer; it is plain to me, it is <hi>not</hi> that which ſome cry up ſo, and content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with, diſſenting from their brethren. <hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> I am ſure is in the Text, and muſt come into Ordination.

               <p>When I read theſe words, it made me call

               <p>According to the form of the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> and the Church in <hi>N.

Now if the queſtion be whether this be lawful or not? where have we warrant for this? that words were thus uſed in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, is plain enough to thoſe who read <hi>Hierom, Ambroſe, Auſtin.</hi> For Scripture this is plain, though ſome of theſe words be not ſet down in the Scripture, yet if there be an <hi>authorizing, appointing, Acts</hi> 6.3. <hi>a ſeparating, ſetting apart, Acts</hi> 13.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170413:54"/>of Heaven gave <hi>Peter</hi> the keys,

For the other words applying to the perſon ordaining, what duties the Scriptures do charge ſuch an office withal; I hope this ought to be, elſe it were a raw bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. So that by neceſſary conſequence from Scripture I cannot well ſee how theſe things can be denied; who can prove the Apoſtles did not uſe ſome ſuch words, though they be not ſet down.

Let others ſpeak more rationally who oppoſe this; and leaving out impoſition of hands, with theſe expreſſions, ſhew what you do, which doth carry in it the <hi>authorizing</hi> of a man to his work. I am ſure there is more reaſon for this, and Scripture will more look to us in it, then there is for that magiſterial power which congregational Miniſters (not Chriſt, that we can find in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) give to the people to keep men as they pleaſe from being admitted into the Church; and hence againſt their Paſtors, qualified men are kept out.</p>
               <p>For the Objections which are made againſt this Text for Ordination, I find theſe.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:170413:54"/>
               <p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> By the ſame reaſon you may ſay, there was no ordination in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in <hi>v.</hi> 3. do not uſe the word <hi>office,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. But I am confident thoſe Divines who uſe this argument, do acknowledge <hi>there</hi> was Ordination.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a perſon be ſeparated to the work of an officer, I think he is ſeparated to the office which that work belongs to.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Prove that; the Text holdeth forth no ſuch thing. <hi>Aretius</hi> ſaith, that in <hi>Acts</hi> 9. <hi>Paul</hi> was not ſent to the Gentiles, but to <hi>Ananias, a quo diſceret

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Preacher before (and ſo had his authoritative <hi>miſſion</hi> I doubt not.) Our Divines in their Comments upon the 1. <hi>v.</hi> reckon up <hi>five</hi> eminent perſons amongſt thoſe <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> mentioned [and this runs moſt ſmoothly] <hi>Saul</hi> muſt be one of thoſe, or elſe five will not be found.

For my part I conceive <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Prophet;</hi> partly becauſe he was <hi>filled with the Holy Ghoſt, Acts</hi> 9.17. [<hi>Paul</hi> had there an authoritative miſſion to preach] as I conceive the Prophets mentioned were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary perſons, and their gifts ſuch for ought any thing I could ever ſee to the contrary as yet: partly becauſe I find Prophets did go from one Church to another, according as there was cauſe, being men ſo extraordinarily fitted for ſervice. Thus <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas, chap.</hi> 15.32. being <hi>Prophets</hi> were ſent, &amp;c. thus <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Prophets came from Jeruſalem to Antioch.</hi> Thus we find <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> joyned and ſent together, <hi>Chapter</hi> 11.30. and 12.25. and theſe two abode together a whole year at <hi>Antioch, Chap.</hi> 11.26. But that he was an Apoſtle before now, I ſee nothing to force it. <hi>Paul</hi> then being one of theſe, and now called to an higher office, this doth not prove <hi>Re-ordination</hi> to the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170413:55"/>
                  <hi>ſame</hi> office: any perſon in office, and called to a higher office, ought to be ordained to it, though he was ordained to an inferiour office before. <hi>Re-ordination</hi> to the <hi>ſame</hi> office I know no warrant for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. After Chriſts Aſcenſion Apoſtles were not choſen in ſuch a private way as that <hi>Acts</hi> 9. would hold out. We find <hi>Matthias, Acts</hi> 1. choſen in a publick and ſolemn manner, God declaring his choiſe. So here in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. in a publick meeting <hi>Paul</hi> is called and ſeparated in a ſolemn manner.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. If <hi>Paul</hi> were ordained an Apoſtle, then the greater was bleſſed of the leſſer: his Apoſtolical power and order was given by them who themſelves had not Apoſtolical power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but Prophets and Teachers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. They were not commanded to <hi>bleſs,</hi> but <hi>ſeparate.</hi> Ordination and bleſſing differ very much; we might as well ſay, Why ſhould the <hi>leſs ſeparate the greater?</hi> ſo we find it here, and it is in vain to diſpute againſt it if God will have it ſo; but this was <hi>extraordinary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Apoſtolical power he received from him who commanded him to be ſeparated, that is, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> yet he is pleaſed to command theſe to ſeparate him to it; and ſurely ſuch perſons who ordain others by vertue of an <hi>immediate command and revelation</hi> from God, though their office be inferiour to the perſons ordained, yet this <hi>immediate command and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> will countervail the act of others who are equal in office.

                  <hi>Paul</hi> might well ſay it was by the <hi>will of God</hi> not of man, that he was an Apoſtle; hence the Text ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>they were ſent forth by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The <hi>call</hi> was from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the command to <hi>ſeparate</hi> them was from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>major</hi> is plain. The <hi>minor,</hi> if any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, let them produce their Scripture-authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

               <p>I have heard it affirmed, and that ſtrongly, from a perſon of no ſmall abilities, that the Fraternity may Preach, Baptize, adminiſten the Supper as well as the Paſtor; the common Scriptures urged by this wilde generation, and <hi>Acts</hi> 10.48. were alledged. I never heard that the Papiſts, or our Biſhops, would allow any private man to baptize in a Church where there were Miniſters preſent; this text would force it, if theſe men argue right, provided they can prove that theſe <hi>brethren</hi> were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170413:58"/>men, and <hi>Peter</hi> not extraordinarily guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which yet they have not done. But a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was granted there are Church-Officers, and ſhall be till the body be perfected, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. If ſo, then theſe Officers have ſome things ſo proper to them, that they are not common to others: But if all men may <hi>preach, baptize, adminiſter the Supper,</hi> there is nothing proper to the Officers: if any thing, it muſt be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which <hi>firſt</hi> is by many denied: But if it be yielded, why may they not take this alſo as well as the reſt? but if Church-officers have nothing proper to them, how are they officers? That officers have ſomething proper to them, I think none can deuy, the nature of the thing will carry it in all Officers: If all can make warrants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where is the office of a Juſtice? and thus in other offices, what is common to all, is proper to none: how are officers known but by their actions?</p>
               <p>To ſay, <hi>That though the brethren doe the ſame things, yet they doe them not as their Officers,</hi> is to ſay nothing. How ſhall we know that? If any man may make a warrant, and that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is as valid as the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> how ſhall a man know who is Juſtice? the name may differ, but not the power, <hi>Ergo,</hi> not the office.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We finde divers promiſes made to the Church of Gods giving Officers, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. &amp; 23.4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.25. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.20. But if every body may do the officers acts, then God ſeems to make promiſes of good to his Church, which are needleſſe; a great ſhew of mercy, but no
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170413:59"/>mercy indeed. There is no need, no uſe of the things promiſed, what would this impute to God?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Divines have maintained againſt the Papiſts that <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. was ſpoken to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and the Miniſters of the word their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and the context will force it, I think, if he ſpoke to the eleven Apoſtles, <hi>v.</hi> 16. And though the Lords Supper is not there mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet ſurely it was there included, there is <hi>par ratio.</hi> Let any man bring a proof from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture or antiquity, that ever any but an officer did adminiſter the Lords Supper. <hi>Docete, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizate,</hi> Matth. 28.19. <hi>Haec dicuntur ſolis Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolis &amp; Miniſtris verbi; certum eſt haec non fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe dicta hominibus privatis.

               <p>I intend to add no more arguments to prove the neceſſity of Ordinantion: I have onely two objections to anſwer, which two eminent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines made againſt me, maintaining the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. <hi>We read of no Ordination but it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed either by extraordinary perſons, or at leaſt ſome ſuch were preſent when they died who know where they left the power. The Biſhop, Presbyter, Fraternity, each of theſe challenge the power, but who knows to whom it belongs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The firſt part of the objection cutts off Ordination wholly [and that is chiefly aimed at:] The ſecond part doth ſeem to yield it, could we but finde who ſhould Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it.</p>
               <p>To the firſt part I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's no wonder though we finde extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary perſons in the adminiſtration of this Ordinance when they were in Being. In the firſt beginnings theſe muſt ordain, or none: we have but the hiſtories of planting of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the New Teſtament, where none were before; and this was done by perſons extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:170413:60"/>2. All that extraordinary perſons did, I hope did not die with them. What is there more extraordinary in Ordination then in <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> why muſt not Preaching die as well as ordination to Preaching? The action is no more then may be performed by ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid (as I know it is) <hi>they conveyed gifts in Ordination,</hi> I ſhall anſwer this when I come to Mr. <hi>Noyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. How ſhall we prove that there were Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters elected without the preſence, acting, guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and conſent of extraordinary officers? I think no man can prove there were any ſo choſen, by the examples we have of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples choiſe; for extraordinary perſons were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preſent, and we finde they acted. By the ſame reaſon throw away Election, which this Divine would hardly doe,
<note place="margin">

               <p n="4">4. Were the Churches ſo blinde, that they could not ſee this to be an extraordinary thing, and that to die with theſe officers? Would the extraordinary officers admit ordinary Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to joyn with them in that work which was proper to them <hi>as extraordinary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</hi> But that they did ſo, the <hi>Epiſt.</hi> to <hi>Timo.</hi> doth plainly carry it, and was, no doubt, the ground of that <hi>Canon.</hi> 3. in <hi>Concil. Carth.</hi> 4. where Presbyters were to impoſe hands with the Biſhop.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:170413:60"/>5. Were the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> writ to them as extraordinary officers? I know when <hi>Timothy</hi> is called upon to do the work of an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> this was proper to him as <hi>ſuch</hi> an officer; but I think, laying aſide that which was proper to them as <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> [which did not conſiſt in the adminiſtration of any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance] thoſe Epiſtles were written to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. <hi>They muſt preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon,</hi> &amp;c. as well as <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy;</hi> and why not I pray <hi>commit the things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2.</note> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. <hi>lay hands on none ſuddenly,</hi> as well as <hi>Timothy?</hi> What extraordinary matter is in this above the other?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Shall perſons come into the Miniſtry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried whether they be fit or unfit, ſound or heretical? No, by no meanes, this is judged a dangerous thing. Men muſt be tried, and that by thoſe who are able to judge [as now we have Commiſſioners.] But what Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule have you for this? If you leave out the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10. I doubt you will hardly finde any in Scripture: but <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and what have we to doe with their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles? but if you will make uſe of thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to mainain your trial of men <hi>[it was a Commiſſioner that made this objection againſt me]</hi> give us leave to make uſe of the ſame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to prove our Ordination of Miniſters; thoſe who are able to do the one, I hope are as able to do the other.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond part of the Objection, I lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regard that. As for the <hi>Fraternty,</hi> let the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170413:61"/>people bring forth their Charter, and ſhew us where the great Lord gave them this power. Againſt this I have argued a little [I intended but a little] in my book againſt the <hi>Separatiſts, p.</hi> 70, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and the <hi>Presbyter</hi> it muſt firſt be proved that theſe are diſtinct officers <hi>jure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi> or elſe the conteſt is vain: this is not a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion for me to handle in this place, but I can ſafely ſay this, there muſt be more brought from <hi>Divine writ</hi> then I ſee is yet brought to prove it, or elſe I can acknowledge no ſuch thing. I ſuppoſe <hi>Biſhop Davenant</hi> in his <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> upon the queſtion, hath ſummed up what can be brought from Scripture, but that will not doe: yet he there in ſome caſes will allow Presbyters to ordain, and I think our caſe is as weighty as any. <hi>Anſelm,</hi> the Popiſh <hi>Canterburian Arch-Biſhop,</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>Titus</hi> 1. [Though I ſee much of it is taken out of <hi>Jerom</hi>] gave me enough to quiet my thoughts about this queſtion; ſuch lines from his pen took much with me conſidering the Scriptures he brought. I am ſure he that made the objection did not own any ſuch diſtinction. I think no ſober Biſhop did ever yet deny the Ordinations in the <hi>French, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Churches to be valid.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Objection was made by another reverend Divine, when I paſſed the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; He put this queſtion to me, <hi>Whether I judged Ordination neceſſary to the Conſtitution of a Miniſter?</hi> I anſwered, <hi>Yes,</hi> if it could be had. He asked me <hi>to which command I would
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170413:61"/>refer Ordination?</hi> I anſwered, to the ſecond. To which he aſſenting added, <hi>Cultus naturalis</hi> could not, nor muſt be laid aſide; but <hi>Cultus Inſtitutus</hi> might rather then <hi>Cultus naturalis</hi> ſhould: <hi>God will have mercy, not ſacrifice</hi> in ſuch a caſe; but if I would ſay Ordination was neceſſary and might now be had, <hi>then I muſt own it by ſucceſſion, and conſequently main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Church of Rome to be a true Church.</hi> Some words then paſſed, but time cut us off.</p>
               <p>To this reverend Divine I ſhall now give a further anſwer:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The firſt part of the ſpeech ſaith no more then we allow, onely when Ordination cannot be had, I think it is not then properly <hi>laid aſide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Preaching,</hi> take the word ſtrictly, as it is the act <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not to be referred to the firſt Commandment (I conceive) but to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; nor do I ſee our Divines make it a part of <hi>Cultus naturalis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This notion will cut off <hi>popular election,</hi> as well as <hi>Ordination,</hi> if preaching belongs to <hi>Cultus naturalis,</hi> for that muſt not be laid aſide, ſaith this Divine; I hope <hi>popular election</hi> doth not belong to the firſt Commandment; then election is as unneceſſary, and if men may preach without <hi>Election and Ordination</hi> we ſhall have brave work. [Preaching here is put for all other Ordinances] where then is the eſſence of a Miniſter according to his owne notion?</p>
               <p>But the laſt part of his ſpeech was that where he put the moſt ſtrength, which yet hath
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170413:62"/>been often anſwered, that I might well ſpare my pains: ſomething I anſwered then, and now will add more.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Divers of our Congregational Divines [of which this reverend Divine is one] conceive [and practiſe accordingly] the <hi>Fraternity</hi> to have power of Ordination; and if ſo, then if <hi>election</hi> may be had, <hi>Ordination</hi> may be had; ſo ſhall it not need be laid aſide, nor ſhall we need trouble our ſelves about <hi>Rome,</hi> that diſpute rather may be laid aſide. I deſired an Anſwer of him what he thought of it, but he would give me none.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſuppoſe his judgement be contrary: According to this argument Ordination, which we are ſure was once an Ordinance of God, [and I have before proved it] muſt be utterly loſt, [unleſs with the <hi>Seekers</hi> we gape for ſome Apoſtles again] For this argument of <hi>Succeſſion</hi> may ever be urged, and will be as ſtrong to the worlds end as now. But why muſt the Church loſe an Ordinance? If the argument be ſo ſtrong againſt Ordination, is it not as ſtrong againſt any thing elſe that came through <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> is no true Church, <hi>ergo</hi> nothing that comes <hi>through Rome</hi> is valid. What will be next? Mr. <hi>Ainſw.</hi> and other Separatiſts zealous enough againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> would not ſay ſo of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> therefore admitted of no <hi>re-baptizing.</hi> Nor would Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> upon the ſame ground admit of <hi>re-ordination;</hi> one was as valid as the other.</p>

                  <hi>Pariſh-Congregations,</hi> they will not deny [the moſt underſtanding and ſober of them] but that <hi>in many pariſhes there are true Churches,</hi> though they will not ſay <hi>the whole pariſh is a true Church,</hi> according to the conſtitution.

               <p>If our State have been rightly guided when they made the Act to Tolerate thoſe who own <hi>One God, Chriſt, and Scriptures,</hi> then a Church in <hi>Rome</hi> may be owned, where theſe and many other truths are maintained, more ſoundly then they will be by many of our tolerated perſons: yea, it were well if all the members of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated Churches in <hi>England</hi> were as ſound in thoſe truths [before mentioned] and as holy in their converſations as are divers who live under <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Pope, were it no more but bare government, compared with the carriage of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170413:65"/>many Church-members, I may ſay as Learned Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> of <hi>N.

               <p>But again, What mean thoſe Texts, <hi>Come out of her my people, Rev.</hi> 18.4. if there be no Church there? <hi>The womans flying into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, Rel.</hi> 12.6. take it as Mr. <hi>Mead,</hi> or as <hi>Pareus,</hi> yet it will argue a true Church to have been under <hi>Rome.</hi> The witneſſes propheſied 1260. days, during the time of the womans being in the wilderneſs they were to feed her; this muſt needs fall under the time before the Reformation, begin it when you will.</p>
               <p>More I could ſay, but I think this is ſufficient to prove that Ordination may and ought ſtill to be continued notwithſtanding <hi>Rome,</hi> and that it is neceſſary to a Miniſter. And ſince both theſe objections are made againſt me by Commiſſioners [though I would hope more <hi>Diſputandi gratiâ,</hi> then being indeed oppoſite to my <hi>Theſis,</hi> I ſay I would be glad to hope ſo] and ſince this <hi>Script</hi> may poſſibly fall into ſome of their hands, I wiſh humbly [and I know I could have hundreds of godly Miniſters to joyn with me] they would pleaſe to take off
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170413:65"/>that offence, which I conceive is juſtly given to the moſt part of the godly Miniſtry in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when they ſee them let into the Miniſtry perſons <hi>illiterate,</hi> and ſome <hi>blame-worthy in their converſations</hi> [as I am informed by godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters who know them] beſides being illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and perſons who neither are ordained, nor will be ordained, nor I think would ſober Miniſters ever ordain them. Theſe things are not ſecret, but more publikely ſpoken off then my Book can publiſh; whence their friends are grieved, their enemies rejoyce, having cauſe they think to open their mouths againſt them, and to vilifie Reformation, beſides the hinderance of union in the Churches.</p>

               <p>ALthough our Divines have <hi>all</hi> I think [un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a few riſen up in our days] agreed in the neceſſity of Ordination to a Miniſter; yet they have not <hi>all</hi> had the ſame thoughts about <hi>Impoſition of hands,</hi> as if it were <hi>neceſſary</hi> to Ordination. Moſt have agreed in this, that though they look on it as a Ceremony, an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct, yet it ought to be practiſed, becauſe of the Apoſtolical examples. Our Congregational Brethen in <hi>Eſſex</hi> caſt it away; and ſome cauſe I have to ſtand upon it, becauſe I therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Ordination by them, becauſe they would
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170413:66"/>not Impoſe hands, and ſo it was the longer before I could be Ordained. If I did refuſe upon inſufficient grounds, I am ſure the grounds which were given to me for the contrary were very inſufficient. I loſt the papers, but met with another manner of Antagoniſt ſhortly after Mr. <hi>Noyes</hi> (a reverend Divine, and my dear friend) of <hi>N. England,</hi> who hath ſaid more againſt it then I have as yet heard from theſe; what any body elſe have ſaid againſt it in writing I know not unleſs the Author of the <hi>Diatribe, &amp;c.</hi> whom that worthy Divine Doctor <hi>Seaman</hi> hath anſwered: I caſt my eye upon it long ſince, but do not now remember any thing <hi>Pro,</hi> or <hi>Con,</hi> what there is ſaid, or in any other man. What then I can gather from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Reaſon I ſhall humbly offer to the Reader, and to Mr. <hi>Noyes</hi> in anſwer to what he hath ſaid againſt it.</p>
               <p>Not many years ſince <hi>Humane Ceremonies</hi> added to the worſhip of God, how much trouble and miſery they added to the Church, we have not yet forgot. Men wrote and ſpake ſo far as they dared, and ſuffered by reaſon of them. Mens wits are now buſied as much in throwing out of God's worſhip, as theirs were in adding; why then we may not now ſtand up in deſence of <hi>God's Ceremonies</hi> [if this be but a Ceremony] as they oppoſed <hi>Mens Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> I know not.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That form of Ordination which cometh neereſt to the Goſpel-pattern, ought to be uſed.</p>
               <p>But Impoſition of hands in Ordination is that form which cometh neereſt to the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pattern; <hi>ergo</hi> Impoſition of hands in Ordination ought to be uſed.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:170413:67"/>
               <p>The <hi>major</hi> I ſuppoſe cannot well be denied, eſpecially by thoſe who in the Biſhops days uſe to cry out ſo much, <hi>All things muſt be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pattern in the Mount;</hi> and why now I pray muſt not things be done according to the pattern of the Goſpel? what do you make of it? that which you may follow, or let alone as you pleaſe? what is ſaid againſt this I ſhall meet with anon.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>minors</hi> bring us forth thoſe rules, or examples which ſhew that men may be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or were ordained without Impoſition of hands: that Church-Officers were ordained with Impoſition, the Texts are known, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If the Goſpel expreſſeth the whole Ordinance of Ordination by Impoſition of hands, then Impoſition of hands in Ordination ought to be uſed.</p>
               <p>But the Antecedent is true, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is true.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Conſequence</hi> is clear; for why ſhould the Apoſtle mention that which is but needleſs, or at leaſt but indifferent to ſet out an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by.</p>

There may be ſome difference put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>narration,</hi> what he did, and <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>injunction</hi> of another, what he <hi>ſhould</hi> do. <hi>Paul</hi> might tell them another time that he prayed for them <hi>ſtanding;</hi> but where doth he order <hi>Timothy,</hi> or others to ordain without Impoſition?</p>
               <p n="4">4. This objection would carry it, as if there were no more in <hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Ordination then in <hi>kneeling</hi> to prayer: which I will not as yet yield; what I have ſaid before I think will ſhew the contrary, and more I ſhall add.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Antecedent</hi> is the part I have to prove, which if I can make good, it will make much to ſhew the neceſſity of Ordination, and of Impoſition in it; the Text is well known. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Lay hands on no man ſuddenly:</hi> the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is whether Ordination be here meant. I named before the judgement of all ſorts of Divines, ancient and modern, <hi>Epiſcopal, Claſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Congregational,</hi> [yea, of divers of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts] who agree it is meant of Ordination: this might be enough one would think; but in our days we muſt prove what we ſay; had our Brethren given us reaſons to the contrary, I
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170413:68"/>might have known what to have anſwered to; but I hear of none.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Impoſition cannot have reference to <hi>ſick perſons:</hi> There's no matter how ſuddenly he laid on hands to cure them; nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the context.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor can it relate to the bleſſing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; the context hath nothing for it: nor did I ever read that the Apoſtles did uſe this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor can it be meant of the Sacrament of Pennance, as many Papiſts do expound it, though ſome of the moſt learned are againſt it, and rather expound it of Ordination, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the context will favour ſomething this notion: but that I have this againſt it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For their Sacrament we reject it; for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of a repenting perſon, before bound under Church-cenſure, this we own; but in Scripture as we have no precept, ſo no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that the Church did uſe to Impoſe hands on a penitent; we read no ſuch thing when the Inceſtuous perſon was looſed, after he had been bound by excommunication; what reaſon then to have it underſtood of that which in Scripture is not to be found; it ſtands with moſt reaſon to expound it with other Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſee <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and others make little of <hi>Impoſition</hi> in the Sacrament of Pennance; but in Ordination he makes it an eſſential part: More reaſon then why of this then of that, which hath no other word for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the Brethren who oppoſe us, I preſume they will not underſtand it thus; for they give
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170413:69"/>ſo much to the people, in admiſſion of members, that <hi>Timothy</hi> might well be hindered for laying hands <hi>ſuddenly</hi> on ſuch: and that 2 <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> with the practiſe of Antiquity, eſpecially <hi>Cyprian</hi> will give ſome ground for it.</p>
               <p>Had it not been for my firſt reaſon, and the reaſons I have to prove it muſt be meant of Ordination, I ſhould have inclined this way becauſe of <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor can it be meant of <hi>Confirmation.</hi> I have heard our Brethren have thus Interpreted it. But</p>
               <p n="1">1. I can ſee no ſhadow of reaſon for this in the context; for the Apoſtle is ſpeaking nothing of Baptiſm, about which time that which men call confirmation was uſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They muſt then prove that <hi>Timothy</hi> had power to confer the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, for ſo we find in confirmation they were given, <hi>Acts</hi> 8, &amp; 9, &amp; 19. Of this more anon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor do I ſee what need of that caution <hi>ſuddenly;</hi> for no matter how ſoon they were confirmed in the faith: they were in the Church already, and to confirm them as faſt as might be was good. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 19. did <hi>ſuddenly</hi> Impoſe hands to this end; good to keep them from Wavering and Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How did <hi>Timothy partake of other mens ſins</hi> when he ſought to confirm them <hi>ſuddenly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Laying then theſe by, the text muſt needs be meant of Ordination, for I know of no other caſes in which hands were Impoſed in the New
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170413:69"/>ſtament, [nor at all in one caſe, <hi>i.e. pennance:</hi>] So that it muſt be this, and that I ſhall yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle from the 17. <hi>v.</hi> had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing about Elders: now it is very ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to give ſome word about the making of Elders. So the context holds it fairly out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Aethiopick Verſion gives it, <hi>Ne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituas quenquam ſubitò:</hi> This is Ordination plainly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The reaſon why he ſhould be cautious, was leſt he <hi>ſhould partake of other mens ſins. Ne reus fias corrupti miniſterii,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aretius.</hi> And it is certain, he that is the cauſe of a corrupt mans coming into the Miniſtry (or inſufficient) may be guilty of much ſin; it is ſo weighty a thing to have the charge of ſouls. <hi>Chryſoſtom,
<note n="*" place="margin">on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.</note> Jerom, Calvin, Chamier, Hemmingius, Cor. a Lap.</hi> ſpeak excellently to this reaſon of the caution.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As the Apoſtle had taught <hi>Timothy</hi> in the 3. Chapter what ſhould be the qualification of Biſhops and Deacons, the former of which he had been ſpeaking of in this Chapter, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Text, it may very well ſuit that <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> ſhould not <hi>ſuddenly</hi> ordain men, but firſt ſee whether they were ſo qualified as he had written to him. So much for this Text.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Text wherein the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth Ordination by <hi>Impoſition</hi> only, is that known place 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.</hi> This Text is generally underſtood of the Ordination of <hi>Timothy.</hi> I never met with any who denied it but one
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170413:70"/>
                  <hi>Socinian.</hi> But of this Text more anon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Text as ſome apprehend, is <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. which Mr. <hi>Noyes</hi> doth very much oppoſe. I could not at firſt tell what was his meaning to beſtow ſo many lines upon it, but at laſt I thought of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> whoſe judgement it is likely Mr. <hi>N.</hi> underſtood; two advantages Mr. <hi>N.</hi> hath: 1. The multitude of Interpreters who underſtand it of <hi>confirmation</hi> (as Mr. <hi>N.</hi> ſaith.) 2. That it followeth Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>But firſt, let us ſee if no Divines underſtand it of Ordination, ſo as it is comprehended at leaſt under it. <hi>Junius, Pareus,</hi> and our <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> take it largely, and look at Ordination included. <hi>Gualter, Toſſanus, Gelleſpio, Dicſon, Johnſon, Jacob. Bullinger</hi> of Ordination <hi>only,</hi> or chiefly. Mr. <hi>Cartw.</hi> thus, <hi>By Impoſition of hands the Apoſtle meaneth no Sacrament,
<note place="margin">Rhem. Teſt.</note> much leſſe confirmation after Baptiſm; but by Trope, or borrowed ſpeech the Miniſtry of the Church, upon the which hands were laid; which appeareth in that whoſoever believeth not there ought to be a Miniſtry by order to teach and govern the Church overthroweth Chriſtianity:</hi> this is to the point indeed.</p>
               <p>Mr.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sur. Ch. Diſ. p.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Hooker</hi> proves that Church Diſcipline is a fundamental point of Religion from hence; thus, <hi>Laying on of hands being by a Metonymy of the Adjunct put for Ordination; and Ordination one particular put for the whole of Diſcipline.</hi> Having then theſe men [and theſe no babes] on my ſide, I will ſee what reaſon there is why Ordination here muſt not be meant.</p>
               <p>For <hi>confirmation</hi> [which ſo many expound
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170413:70"/>it of] I ſearched amongſt thoſe Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines which I had to find a definition of it in our Proteſtant ſenſe, and why they call it ſo; but I could not find one who gave me ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction but <hi>Chemnitius, Exam. Concil. Trid. de confirmat.</hi> The Papiſts definition I knew, and a pretty one it is. That which <hi>Chemnitius</hi> ſpeaks gave me great content; but I could wiſh ſome body would, prove this is the meaning of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> in this Text, for then we ſhould have one more ſtrong ground for <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> as we may gather by <hi>Chemnitius</hi> opening of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. Caſting my eye on <hi>Diodati</hi> I ſee he thus expounds it, and hence gathers <hi>Infant-Bpatiſm.</hi> But this is not ſufficient; we call for proof now. I know <hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> was after Baptiſm in Scripture, except <hi>Act.</hi> 9.17. and ſo far as we can learn from Scripture, we find</p>
               <p n="1">1. Extraordinary gifts were ever the effect of it. So <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. nor do we find any other end of it; theſe gifts being conveyed in a way above nature, might very well tend to the confirming them in their <hi>faith</hi> received, and ſo well called <hi>confirmation.</hi> But in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation we talk of there is no ſuch thing, nor do I ſee why we ſhould call it confirmation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The perſons who did Impoſe hands, were either Apoſtles, or perſons extraordinarily raiſed. We read but of one <hi>Ananias, Acts</hi> 9. I do not find the Evangeliſts did Impoſe. Hence the Biſhops, who call themſelves the Apoſtles ſucceſſors, they claime this power, and poore Presbyters muſt not do it [at leaſt without leave from them.]</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:170413:71"/>
               <p>That then which truly deſerves the name <hi>confirmation,</hi> is ceaſed many hundred years ſince. But for the thing it ſelf, which our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines call confirmation, as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> lays it down,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inſtit. l.</hi> 4. c. 19. <hi>ſ.</hi> 4.</note> I could heartily wiſh with <hi>Calvin</hi> that it were brought into practiſe, only <hi>Impoſition,</hi> I think, might be left out; yet I would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with him who did uſe it, rather ſo, then not have the thing practiſed. <hi>Muſculus</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Impoſition</hi> in confirmation, ſaith, The <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Apoſtles was of miraculous operation,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Loc. Com. p.</hi> 321.</note> and ceaſed long ſince: Exemplum illius retinue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt Epiſcopi, quo magis Apoſtolorum viderentur eſſe ſucceſſores.</hi> But he ſpeaks nothing againſt Impoſition in Ordination.</p>
               <p>But to the Text; let us ſee why Ordination muſt be ſhut out here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The key of Interpretation I take to be the word <hi>Foundation and principles, &amp;c.</hi> (as we Tranſlate.) So <hi>Camerarius, Sunt neceſſaria Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata &amp; Capita doctrinae Chriſtianae quae enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur hoc loco.</hi> So <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi> Now it ſeems ſtrange to me that a <hi>foundation</hi> ſhould be loſt out of the Church above fifteen hundred years. I thought foundations ſhould hold ſo long as the building laſts; take away a foundation the houſe muſt be in danger. But if this be meant of Ordination, then it holds; for the Miniſtry ſhall hold ſo long as the Church holds; <hi>till the body be perfected, Eph.</hi> 4. But if <hi>confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and extraordinary gifts, which were the only effect, ſo far as we find in Scripture, [as before I touched] then this foundation is gone long ſince.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:170413:71"/>2. <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> are to laſt to the end of the world. Some of our Divines do from this Text prove againſt the <hi>Socinians</hi> that <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> is an ordinance ſtill to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, becauſe it is put amongſt the foundations, Chatechetical heads; why then the Miniſtry, which is Chriſt's great ordinance, to <hi>convert,</hi> to beget <hi>faith, [which comes by hearing, &amp;c.]</hi> and authorized to <hi>baptize</hi> to <hi>the end of the world,</hi> ſhould not be meant by <hi>Impoſition,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20.</note> but a temporary thing which was to vaniſh preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I can ſee no reaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Impoſition alone is put for Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have other Scriptures to ſhew. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5, &amp; 4. [as before] but ſhew us another Text where Impoſition alone is put for <hi>confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Extraordinary gifts were conveyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Impoſition of hands: as <hi>Act.</hi> 2.10. &amp; <hi>Act.</hi> 44.4. why then <hi>Impoſition</hi> ſhould only ſignifie the Holy Ghoſt, which yet was given without it, I am not ſatisfied.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then theſe Divines muſt prove, that <hi>all</hi> who were baptized had hands Impoſed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts conferred, elſe the placing after Baptiſm proves nothing; if onely to ſome baptized perſons and <hi>pro tempore,</hi> what is this to prove it meant of <hi>confirmation;</hi> for I hope <hi>all</hi> baptized ones are to be confirmed in their ſenſe. But this will be hard to prove.</p>
               <p>One thing more I ſhall add when I come to Mr. <hi>Noyes,</hi> why it ſhould be meant of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts; <hi>Camero</hi> gives the ſtrongeſt reaſon. But yet I hope to an indifferent Reader, it
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170413:72"/>doth appear by what I have ſaid, that there is no forcing reaſon why Ordination ſhould be ſhut out, but may at leaſt be fairly implied. So much for my ſecond argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. That Act which the Church ever uſed [and that regularly] in ordaining of Officers, ought to be uſed in Ordination.</p>
               <p>But Impoſition of hands is an Act which the Church ever uſed [and that regularly] in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> ſeems ſo fair, that I think no rational man will deny it. The <hi>Minor</hi> is clear; the Church under the Old Teſtament uſed this act. <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.10. Upon which verſe Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> thus ſpeaketh, <hi>This rite was kept at the Ordination of Officers, both in the Old Teſtament and in the New.</hi> Acts 6.6. &amp; 13.3. <hi>By this ſign they did put the charge and ſervice of the Church upon them, &amp;c.</hi> Then why it ought not ſtill to be uſed, I know not. Mr. <hi>Ainſ.</hi> was a man learned, holy, and far from Popery, or idle Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Let us ſuppoſe Prayer and Faſting to be of the eſſence of Ordination [as ſay our Brethren.]</p>
               <p>If Prayer and Faſting without Impoſition do not difference Ordination from another Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, then Impoſition of hands ought to be uſed in Ordination.</p>
               <p>But the Antecedent is true, <hi>ergo</hi> the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is true.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of the <hi>Conſequence</hi> is, becauſe every Ordinance hath ſomething in it whereby it is diſtinguiſhed from others; ſo muſt this have ſomething.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:170413:72"/>
               <p>Here I lie open to two <hi>Objections.</hi> Some will ſay, Why do not you put in thoſe words which they call <hi>verba creantia,</hi> where ſome put the very eſſence of the Ordinance? To theſe I anſwer,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Weems</hi> ſaith, In their Churches when they Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter they give him the Book of God in his hand, to ſignifie that now he hath power to preach the word, as the Prieſts hand was filled with fleſh <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.3. P. 105.</note> Although I do agree with the old <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts,</hi> and other Churches, that ſome ſuch words <hi>muſt</hi> be uſed, and by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it will be forced, [as before I ſpake] yet I rather uſe this, becauſe it is my <hi>queſtion,</hi> and that which we have plain Scripture for, and ſo feeling Scripture at my back, ſhall be more able to make good my ground.</p>
               <p>The other party ſay, by this I put the <hi>form</hi> of Ordination in Impoſition; for <hi>forms di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh.</hi> I do not at this time aſſert what it is, but finding it in Scripture, I argue againſt thoſe who leave it out. <hi>Walaeus</hi> we ſee could not tell whether to call it a <hi>Rite,</hi> or an <hi>eſſential part.</hi> I know <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and other Papiſts look on it as part of the eſſence of Ordination, and if they do ſo, I do not blame them [they having Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for it] as I blame thoſe who leave it out.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> in his <hi>Review of the nature of S. p.</hi> 23. tells us that by Ordination of Miniſters, <hi>many upon a miſtake underſtand only the Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands uſed therein.</hi> [I have not met with any of this opinion; I find none of the Papiſts ſpeaking thus, who make as much of it as any] then adds, <hi>Ordination of Miniſters is one thing, Impoſition of hands is another, differing as the whole and the part.</hi> Enough.</p>
               <p>If a <hi>Totum,</hi> then <hi>Totum univerſale</hi> he cannot mean, but <hi>Totum Integrale:</hi> then Impoſition of hands ſtands affected to Ordination as <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:170413:73"/>to <hi>Integrum,</hi> which is <hi>Symbolum cauſae eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentialis;</hi> then not an Adjunct. If it be a part, and a principal part, then where there is no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition there is no Ordination, for <hi>ſublatâ parte principali, tollitur Integrum.</hi> If it be not a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, but leſs principal, yet Ordination is but Imperfect; for <hi>ſublatâ quâlibet parte tollitur per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio Integri.</hi> Then let thoſe who are ordained [as they ſay they are] without Impoſition of hands, conſider their Ordination, and I hope they cannot be offended with me for refuſing (at beſt) an imperfect ordination, when I could have a more perfect Ordination. One of their own Ordainers hath ſpoken enough for me.</p>
               <p>I pray tell us how praying and faſting for a bleſſing upon a perſon elected, is an Ordinance diſtinct. We Pray and Faſt for <hi>rain,</hi> for <hi>fair ſeaſons,</hi> for <hi>peace,</hi> for <hi>ſucceſs in war,</hi> for <hi>health,</hi> for <hi>counſel in great affairs, &amp;c.</hi> But I hope pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and faſting for theſe ends does not make theſe ſeveral and diſtinct Ordinances; but it ſeems it ſhould be ſo, as well as praying &amp; faſting for a bleſſing on a perſon elected makes this a diſtinct Ordinance; prayer and faſting is but one Ordinance by it ſelf uſed for many ends.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we ſeldom faſt and pray [nay, never I think] at a neighbour Congregation, but the Miniſters uſe to pray for a bleſſing upon the Miniſter of that Congregation, then it ſeems <hi>ſo often we Ordain him;</hi> this is abſurd.</p>
               <p>Alſo good people faſt and pray before ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, what is it then? I know not how they will avoid it, but they muſt confound Election and Ordination, which I am ſure is contrary to Scripture.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:170413:73"/>
               <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to <hi>Timothy,</hi> he did not charge him that he ſhould not <hi>faſt and pray ſuddenly,</hi> but not <hi>Impoſe hands ſuddenly.</hi> Words uſed which ſignifie <hi>ſending, ſetting apart, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing to the office</hi> with Impoſition of hands; do diſtinguiſh Ordination from other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt Argument I ſhall uſe will be <hi>ad hominem,</hi> yet I think there is ſomething in it.</p>
               <p>If Satan from a wicked Imitation of God hath made uſe of Impoſition of hands in the conſecration of <hi>his</hi> Miniſters, then Chriſtians, from an obediential Imitation of God, ought to uſe Impoſition of hands in the Ordination of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Satan in his worſhip hath ever loved to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate God in his worſhip. As <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Apol.</hi> 2. and <hi>Tertul. Praeſcrip. adv. Haeret.</hi> both ſhew how this Ape hath taken example from the worſhip God had appointed in his houſe, and accordingly appointed the form of his worſhip. So in the conſecration of his Prieſts, <hi>Livy</hi> reports of <hi>Numa</hi> that hands were Impoſed upon his head, <hi>cum ſummo ſacerdotio initiaretur.</hi> Why ſhould not we upon another principle ſtick cloſe then to the examples in the Word, ſince the Divel thinks there is ſomething in it, I ſuppoſe he took it from the <hi>Levites.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>The ſumme is, we have examples indeed but no commands, and therefore indifferent. To which I ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then make the rule general; <hi>What ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples ſoever we have in the word, for which we find no commands, thoſe examples are but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, we may follow or not.</hi> This muſt be a certain truth, elſe we ſhall ask the reaſon, why ſome examples having no commandment are to be imitated, but the examples of Impoſition of hands in Ordination are not to be imitated? [I know all examples are not imitable, but I cannot lanch forth in that diſcourſe] See what follows. Hence</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Popular election</hi> of a Miniſter is a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. I regard not whether I be elected or not; we have ſome examples [though none ſuch as our popular elections] indeed, but we find no command, that the <hi>plebs</hi> ſhould chooſe their Miniſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chemnitius</hi> had been pleading for popular election, and to prove it brings in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples out of the New Teſtament; when he had done, he adds <hi>Haec exempla Apoſtolicae Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriae clarè oſtendunt electionem pertinere ad uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſam Eccleſiam, certo quodam modo ut ſuae in electione ſeu vocatione ſint partes &amp; Presbyterii &amp; populi.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:170413:74"/>
               <p>But if <hi>Chemnitius</hi> will plead for more then an indifferency in it, I muſt bar this play, to have him come in with <hi>Haec exempla.</hi> I can ſhew him <hi>Haec exempla</hi> more clear for Ordination by Impoſition, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence the conſent of the people in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions [for which I know neither example nor command] and excommunications of members is but indifferent; for the latter though it may be conceived we have an example, yet no command.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence there is no Independent Church: with divers more things which I would draw from hence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I anſwer, if Impoſition of hands carry thoſe five things in it which <hi>Chemnitius, Ib. p.</hi> 221. tells us, then I know no reaſon why he ſhould call it an <hi>indifferent</hi> thing. At the end of that <hi>para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph</hi> he is ſtill ſpeaking of <hi>Impoſition,</hi> as I think, and ſaith <hi>Nititur mandato,</hi> &amp;c. having quoted <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. See <hi>Zanchy</hi> 4. <hi>praec. p.</hi> 785, 786.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> in his <hi>Review</hi> [before quoted] <hi>p.</hi> 23, 24. ſaith, <hi>For that part of Ordination which conſiſts in the Impoſition of hands by the Presbytery [where it may be obtained according to the mind of Chriſt] I am alſo very remote from managing any oppoſition to it. I think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by vertue of precept; and that to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in a way of ſucceſſion. It is I ſay according to the mind of Chriſt, that he who is to be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto office in any Church receive Impoſition of hands from the Elders of that Church, if there be any therein.</hi> But what, I pray, if there be no
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170413:75"/>Elders, what is the mind of Chriſt then that they muſt be ordained without it? here the Doctor conceals his judgement; but I can help the Reader to underſtand his judgement [if he have not changed it] he would have Ordained me <hi>with</hi> Impoſition of hands [and there were no Elders in our Church to do it] if the other Miniſter would have Impoſed hands alſo. Then ſtill I had reaſon to refuſe an Ordination where ſomething of a <hi>precept</hi> was left out, unleſs a Scripture can be brought to prove that the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it by vertue of <hi>precept</hi> ceaſes where there are no Elders in the Church. This Scripture is deſired.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it be <hi>indifferent,</hi> then it may be uſed; there can be no ſin in uſing it; we have an Apoſtolical example for it, <hi>Confitente, Polano.</hi> Then</p>
               <p n="1">1. This will give a man more ſatisfaction, as to his Ordination whether it were regular or not, when he finds it anſwer the Apoſtolical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. I would not have that ſcruple to lie upon me about my own Ordination, whether it were valid or not, becauſe I had Impoſition, for much.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This will tend more to union; for now there is an occaſion of difference for want of this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is great and juſt matter of offence to the Epiſcopal party, who in ſome caſes do allow Presbyters may Ordain, but whether Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation can be without Impoſition of hands, I do not know they are reſolved for the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Things then which tend to union, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170413:75"/>taking of offences and ſcruples out of mens minds, if they may be done, and no ſin in ſo doing, I think ought to be done.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Impoſition of hands, which we conceive Apoſtolical men, directed by the Spirit of God, tranſlated from the Old Teſtament to the New, had an expreſs command for it in the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Levites to their office, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.10. it was not indifferent then, why now?</p>
               <p n="5">5. When the Apoſtle gives <hi>Timothy</hi> this charge, <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man;</hi> and when the Lord commanded them to ſeparate <hi>Paul,</hi> they anſwer the command by Impoſition <hi>Acts</hi> 13. I am miſtaken if we find not a precept here. If <hi>Timothy</hi> hath a rule for the <hi>modification</hi> of his Act, and that Act, for ought we can find, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly uſed in this part of Inſtituted worſhip, I think the Act it ſelf muſt needs be commanded. For acts in themſelves civil, and uſed amongſt men, even Heathens, as being cuſtomes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if we find the Scriptures many hundred years after their civil uſe, to add a modification to ſuch Acts, whether we are bound to ſuch Acts where there is no ſuch national cuſtomes, I much queſtion. The thing the Lord intends in them, be it humility, hoſpitality, love, we are bound to, that's true; but I ſuppoſe not to the meer civil acts of other Nations, but from hence to caſt out Impoſition, I cannot yield to it. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. I cannot find that it was their cuſtome to ſeparate men in Civil States to the Office of a Magiſtrate by Impoſition of hands, and that God took this up from them. <hi>Joſhua</hi> indeed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170413:76"/>was thus appointed to his office, but by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.18. but where doe we find this civil cuſtome before, thus to lay hands on Magiſtrates?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>thing</hi> the Scripture intends in the civil Acts of Nations we may ſhew and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, though we follow not the civil cuſtomes of other Nations; but this being an Act belonging to Inſtituted worſhip, I know not how the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf is performed [at leaſt not perfectly] without it.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.9.</note> As for <hi>Joſhua,</hi> though the ſpirit of the Lord was given in a larger meaſure at this Impoſition, yet this was not the only end intended, for then <hi>Moſes</hi> might have Impoſed his hands in a private Tent, and not before <hi>all the Congregation, and there give him his charge, v.</hi> 22, 23. but <hi>Moſes</hi> did by this Act declare the <hi>Deſignation</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi> of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> to his Office before the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So it is in Ordaining of Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it were a Jewiſh cuſtome, and upon that account only uſed, why ſhould <hi>Paul</hi> command <hi>Timothy</hi> a Greek to uſe it, and that in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Officers to Gentile-Churches where no ſuch cuſtome was?</p>
               <p>From theſe grounds I do not yet look upon Impoſition as being a thing indifferent; but I look at Ordination without it, at leaſt as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular: and let me ſpeak my mind freely, I would rather choſe to be ordained by a Biſhop and Presbyters [which many cry out upon as Antichriſtian] then be Ordained by any other without Impoſition.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee what Mr. <hi>Noyes</hi> hath written againſt it. I ſhall begin at his third Argument
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170413:76"/>againſt it, becauſe that ſtrikes at the examples in Scripture, and is the very Argument our Brethren here now uſe, and indeed if that can be made good, I ſhall not much ſtand upon Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. He ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe examples are not a warrant for us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were either extraordinary perſons [as Apoſtles] or extraordinary Presbyters, or they were extraordinarily raiſed who did Impoſe hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that of <hi>Timothy</hi> he ſaith, <hi>It conferred an extraordinary and ſenſible gift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All <hi>extraordinary</hi> it ſeems, but by this we ſhall not loſe only <hi>Impoſition</hi> but <hi>Ordination</hi> alſo, which yet Mr. <hi>N.</hi> owns: the ſame obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was againſt Ordination, as we ſaw before; and certainly if Mr. <hi>N.</hi> takes away thoſe Texts which ſpeak of Impoſition, I know of few Texts he will find to prove his <hi>Ordination.</hi> I deſire Mr. <hi>N.</hi> would give us ſtrong proof for Ordination, leaving out thoſe Texts: ſo that we ſhall have nothing left but election, and I think he will hardly prove any election, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in extraordinary perſons had not their hand: ſo at laſt loſe all.</p>
               <p>But how doth he prove theſe Impoſed hands <hi>quà</hi> extraordinary perſons? The example in <hi>Timothy</hi> [the Presbytery which laid hands on him] and <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. he foreſaw would be alledged; to theſe two he lays in anſwer afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, telling us they <hi>were extraordinary Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Say what Presbyters and prove; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Presbyters are enumerated. 1. The <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>N.E.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> nor a thouſand more ever thought of any ſuch thing; the <hi>Synod</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:170413:77"/>conceive it was the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> which Impoſed hands on <hi>Timothy. Junius</hi> conceives it was the Presbytery of <hi>Derbe and Lyſtra</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> took him,

               <p>For <hi>Acts</hi> 13. he ſaith, theſe ſeem to be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Elders. 1. <hi>Partly by their Ambulatory courſe [ordinary Elders are no where deſcribed by the title of Doctors only.</hi>] 2. <hi>Partly becauſe it is evident ſome of them were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prophets, yet they are all put together as equal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1.

               <p n="3">3. Though there were ſome extraordinary Officers there, yet that hinders not, but the whole teaching Presbytery of <hi>Antioch</hi> might joyn in the ſeparation of <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſo in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of hands: how will Mr. <hi>N.</hi> prove the <hi>Teachers</hi> were excluded; neither doth it follow, becauſe they are numbred together therefore they were equal. Prophets here [as in other Texts] are named <hi>before,</hi> and as <hi>diſtinct</hi> from Teachers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ordinary Presbyters might not impoſe upon extraordinary Presbyters,</hi> this I think he would have; but have you a Scripture-rule which forbids it? what if God will have it ſo. If <hi>Paul</hi> were now made the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, as all that I ſee but Mr. <hi>N.</hi> do acknowledge, then though only the Prophets had Impoſed, yet here inferiour officers impoſed on ſuperiour: for Apoſtles were ſuperiour to Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. and I hope by the ſame reaſon a Presbytery might impoſe on <hi>Timotby</hi> an <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and the Synod of <hi>N.E.</hi> ſay Presbyters [not extraordinary] impoſed hands on <hi>Timothy</hi> an Evangeliſt.</p>
               <p>To ſay inferiour may not impoſe, when the Text ſaith, theſe did Impoſe, [and it lieth upon Mr. <hi>N.</hi> to prove which were excluded] is flatly to deny the Text.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:170413:78"/>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>N.</hi> ſaith, <hi>He was no Apoſtle yet, and his proof is, becauſe the Apoſtles long after this time gave him the right hand of fellowſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. If there were no Apoſtles at <hi>Antioch</hi> now [as doubtleſs there were none, for then they would have been mentioned as well as inferiour Officers] then Apoſtles could not <hi>now</hi> give him the right hand of fellowſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why ſhould their right hand of fellowſhip make him an Apoſtle? that I ſuppoſe he doth not mean; he was one before they gave him the right hand [it is ſo in inferiour Officers.] <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he was called to be an Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1. What, when they gave him the right hand of fellowſhip? or here where God ſaith ſo? <hi>I have called him.</hi> Mr. <hi>N.</hi> in this is ſingular, and his proofs not ſufficient.</p>
               <p>He further proveth that they <hi>as</hi> extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſons did Impoſe, becauſe <hi>there was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and ſenſible gift conferred on Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:</hi> and thus much he inſinuateth in his fourth Argument. <hi>The extraordinary gift ceaſeth in reſpect of Ordination;</hi> ergo <hi>it muſt be removed, as from prayers for the ſick and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is ſomewhat like, and this I have heard urged; I know nothing to take off Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition but this, if it can be proved. If Mr. <hi>N.</hi> can carry this, he ſhall carry me: But how proves he this? Thus; it had this effect upon <hi>Timothy, ergo.</hi> What? it had the ſame upon <hi>all,</hi> and this was the end of Impoſition. But this Mr. <hi>N.</hi> muſt prove: If I can prove the contrary, then I muſt tell Mr. <hi>N.</hi> to argue <hi>a particulari
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170413:78"/>ad univerſale</hi> is none of the beſt Logick. But of <hi>Timothy</hi> more anon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Apoſtles <hi>Acts</hi> 6. when they Impoſed hands, did it not to confer ſuch gifts. For 1. They ſay plainly it was to <hi>appoint</hi> them, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>to ſuch a work, i. e.</hi> they were made Deacons [I think Mr. <hi>N.</hi> will not deny.] 2. They were to ſeek out men <hi>full of the Holy Ghoſt and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> they were then gifted before Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. when the Prophets and Teachers were commanded to Impoſe hands on <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> the end was not to confer extraordinary gifts; <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>filled with the Holy Ghoſt, Acts</hi> 9. when <hi>Ananias</hi> Impoſed hands. The end here was to <hi>ſeparate</hi> them, &amp;c. the Old Teſtament-word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Timothy</hi> had command to Impoſe hands [in Ordination I doubt not] 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. But that <hi>Timothy</hi> conferred extraordinary gifts, is a task for Mr. <hi>N.</hi> to undertake to prove. <hi>Philip</hi> was an Evangeliſt, but it ſeems he could not do it. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15, 17. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did this: beſides that all the ordinary Presbyters [for I hope ſome were ordinary] had extraordinary gifts, ſeems ſtrange.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Timothy</hi> is charged to <hi>commit the things, &amp;c. to ahle</hi> men. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. So <hi>Titus</hi> hath order ſent him to Ordain men qualified, gifted, ſuch as muſt be <hi>able by ſound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gain-ſayers.</hi> So in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. the Biſhop muſt be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> what need this caution? For if they by Impoſition of hands, could confer extraordinary gifts,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170413:79"/>they could make them <hi>able,</hi> be they never ſo weak before. As we finde in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and <hi>Acts</hi> 19. when the Apoſtles after Baptiſm Impoſed hands, they did not look at their ability or inability, they made them able preſently.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Impoſition was in practice before this time under the Old Teſtament, from whence [as ſay our Divines] it was tranſlated into the New Teſtament, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.10. But I hope the Iſraelites did not thereby confer extraordinary gifts, it was one Act in their ſeparation of the Levites.</p>
               <p>Now for <hi>Timothy,</hi> who is the only proof of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> his Argument. I wiſh Mr. <hi>N.</hi> had opened the Text more fully.

               </p>
               <p>For this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the thoughts of Divines are very various; but the moſt probable fall under one of theſe two heads. 1. Either thoſe gracious qualifications by which he was fitted for his work. Or 2. The <hi>Docendi officium,</hi> the very office and place unto which men through grace are fitted. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. This is moſt generally received. <hi>Gerhard</hi> takes in both, but doth not reckon extraordinary gifts; he ſaith, <hi>Gratiam docendi, exhortandi, Scripturas interpretandi, contradictores redarguendi.</hi> I think he ſaith trueſt. Yet as <hi>Zanchy</hi> before, ſo I conceive <hi>Timothy</hi> had ſome degree of thoſe gifts before, though now more increaſed and confirmed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if the gifts were extraordinary, let him tell us how <hi>Timothy</hi> ſhould ſtir up <hi>extraordinary</hi> gifts.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:170413:80"/>3. Where doth he finde extraordinary gifts conferred by a <hi>Presbytery?</hi> which is here diſtinct from <hi>Paul,</hi> who was an extraordinary Officer. <hi>Presbyter</hi> is the common word for an ordinary Paſtor in the New Teſtament; and when it is named as diſtinct from other extraordinary Officers, I know not why it ſhould not be meant of an ordinary Presbyter, and ſo this Presbytery but ordinary: to <hi>ſay</hi> this gift was extraordinary, and the Presbytery extraordinary without ſufficient proof will not ſatisfie a rational man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I had another Notion, but was afraid to ſet it down, leſt I ſhould be charged with ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, as is Mr. <hi>N.</hi> 't was this, Suppoſe the gift were extraordinary, yet it ſhould ſeem to be given <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> comprehends the <hi>Miniſterium eccleſiaſticum</hi> to which <hi>Timothy</hi> was ordained, he being by <hi>Propheſie</hi> deſigned to it being <hi>young,</hi> the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery might well Impoſe hands with <hi>Paul</hi> to ſeparate him to his office, as <hi>Paul</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be ſeparated, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. Here the prepoſition is changed, it is not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. I knew no hurt in this Notion, nor what fault could be found with it, only (as I ſaid) I feared ſingularity. But caſting my eye upon <hi>Diodati</hi> I ſaw he concurred with me in my Notion. <hi>By the Impoſition of</hi> Paul's <hi>hands,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.16. Timothy <hi>received the extraordinary gift. By
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170413:80"/>the Impoſition of the Colledge of Elders hands,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.14. <hi>He was inſtalled in the Miniſtry with a publick bleſſing.</hi> Thus he on 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Didoclavius,</hi> whom reverend Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> follows, obſerved the difference in the phraſe, but whether he meant as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> doth I know not. For thus Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> 
                  <q>By gift he underſtands thoſe gracious abilities which <hi>Timothy</hi> received by the ſpirit in way of Propheſie, whence he was fitted to be an Evangeliſt. It is <hi>by</hi> the hands of <hi>Paul</hi> there is a cauſal vertue under Chriſt of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but it is <hi>with</hi> the hands of the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as concurring by way of Approbation only.</q> Thus he. That <hi>Paul's</hi> hands ſhould <hi>cauſaliter conſtituere</hi> gracious qualifications, and that the hands of the Elderſhip ſhould onely concur by way of Approbation that <hi>Timothy</hi> ſhould have ſuch qualifications ſeems ſomething odd: What need of their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or approbation? Nor do I think <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> here is taken in that ſenſe the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth uſe it.</p>
               <p>I hope by this time this Argument of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> uſed by our Brethren doth not appeare ſtrong enough to remove Impoſition: as for the reſt of his Arguments I will now take them in order, omitting what is needleſs.</p>
               <p>His firſt Argument is, <hi>Impoſition is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted in Ordination by Impoſition on the Levites.</hi> He giveth divers reaſons; I can yield to divers things without hurting my cauſe.</p>
               <p>His fift reaſon, <hi>Iſrael Impoſed hands on the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170413:81"/>Levites, to ſignifie that they were to bear their ſins, and make attonement for them,</hi> Exod. 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. There is no ſuch thing mentioned in the Chapter quoted. In <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.3. the <hi>Levites</hi> were not to meddle with the Prieſts office; no not to ſprinkle blood. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The 14. <hi>verſe</hi> tells us it was a part of the <hi>ſeparation</hi> of the Levites: nor do we make this our firſt warrant.</p>
               <p>His fift reaſon, <hi>This was a Jewiſh Ceremony, and why ſhould this, all other being abrogated, be only reſerved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the Apoſtles give the Anſwer; Why did they uſe it? and <hi>Paul</hi> bid <hi>Timothy</hi> uſe it? Let him blame <hi>Paul if Impoſition upon the Ordained be a Ceremonial Law which took end by the coming of Chriſt, then the Apoſtles were injurious unto his death, who tranſlated that Ceremony from the Jews under the Law into the Church under the Goſpel,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Cartwright, Reply p.</hi> 221. More anon.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Argument from <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. <hi>doth not hold it forth in point of Ordination, but it is a fundamental principle of religion, uſed figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively for the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, which is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and conferred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Then Mr. <hi>N.</hi> of all men muſt not exclude Ordination, in which it conferred extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts [as he hath affirmed before] for that time then it muſt comprehend Ordination; his own Notion confutes himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I think as he ſaith [and ſo in his ſixth reaſon, which I will therefore omit] it was a <hi>fundamental principle,</hi> and therefore ſhould
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170413:81"/>ſtand ſo long as the Church ſtands. Let the Reader be pleaſed to caſt his eye upon what I have ſaid concerning the Text before.</p>
               <p>His firſt reaſon hath there its anſwer alſo.</p>
               <p>His ſecond and third reaſons, I think, aim both at the ſame thing. <hi>Doctrine is added to Baptiſm, and Impoſition, to intimate the doctrine of the Ordinance, not the Ordinance it ſelf was intended: the communication of the Spirit is the thing ſignified, or the doctrine of Impoſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Is indeed the Doctrine of Baptiſm here only intended, and not the Ordinance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm it ſelf? I muſt requeſt him to excuſe me, I intend not to give ſo much advantage to the <hi>Socinians.</hi> I think the Ordinance is plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſo is Impoſition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Doth not the Apoſtle then <hi>Tautologize?</hi> Do not <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> comprehend much of the doctrine of Baptiſm? why ſhould the Ordinance be mentioned if not intended?</p>
               <p n="3">3. What error is there if we read the words dividedly, with a Comma betwixt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as do the <hi>Tigurin</hi> and <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. So <hi>Oecumenius, Luther, Eraſmus, Gagnaeus,</hi> as <hi>Gerhard</hi> ſaith, and the Greek do not oppoſe it; Thus <hi>Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Aretius:</hi> See their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Then this notion fails, and it will make yet more for my Interpretation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But let us ſuppoſe the Doctrine of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be here intended: Yet as <hi>Aretius</hi> ſaith well <hi>in loc. De hac ceremonia admonebantur Neophyti, quandoquidem tum in frequenti erat uſu, quid illa eſſet, cur inſtituta, quibus, &amp; per
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170413:82"/>quos imponerentur manus: item ad quid condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret diſcebant Fidei Tyrones.</hi> Very good: muſt not then the <hi>Neophyti</hi> anſwer, Hands were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in Ordination of Church Officers? If we come to teach ours this head of Catechiſm, and they muſt anſwer according to Mr. <hi>N.</hi> his notion, they may well ſay, What is this to us? how is it a foundation to us, the thing is ceaſed ſo many hundred years ſince? [beſides what I have before ſaid.] But according to our Interpretation, we both open the Doctrine, we uſe the thing, and it remains as yet a Foundation to us. The old holy <hi>non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> tell us how they look upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry: there was an objection made, <hi>We have been taught heretofore that Diſcipline is an eſſential part of the Goſpel and matter of Faith.</hi> To this they anſwer,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That Diſcipline of the Church [being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally underſtood] is a matter of Faith, and an eſſential mark of the Church, I hope our Brethren will not deny; for Diſcipline comprehendeth not only the Adminiſtration of the Keys, but Ordination and Impoſition of hands: but without Ordination there are no Preachers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. and without Preaching there is no belief, <hi>v.</hi> 14. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without ſome part of Diſcipline it cannot be denied but that the Church is no Church, Faith no Faith. Thus they.</q> This ſuites Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s expoſition of our Text.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If the confirmation and increaſing of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts be the Spirit's work, then ſtill it may hold, as <hi>Zanch.</hi> and <hi>Chamier</hi> before.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:170413:82"/>
               <p>His fourth and fifth reaſons are anſwered before: onely whereas he ſaith, <hi>Impoſition is added as an explicative adjunct of Baptiſm.</hi> It ſhould ſeem no [beſides what have been ſaid] there being ſo few heads enumerated, it's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely the Apoſtle would add an Adjunct to this ordinance, [which I think he cannot prove was alwayes at Baptiſme.] I thinke alſo this croſſeth the former head, wherein he ſaid, Not Baptiſme, but the Doctrine of Baptiſme is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>His ſeventh it is interpreted in the next, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>Illumination anſwers to repentance, Taſte of the heavenly gift to Faith, the participation of the Holy Ghoſt to the doctrine of Impoſition and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, the taſting of the good word to the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This doth not pleaſe. Illumination, as moſt underſtand the word belonging to the Intellectual part, and repentance to the heart, do not ſeem to anſwer. I know <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the 1. <hi>v.</hi> if the word be taken ſtrictly as the word ſounds belongs to the minde, but ſo as it's Act is perfected in the heart; it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The <hi>Syriack</hi> render <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> otherwiſe; and that Baptiſme is taken for Illumination among the Ancients, according to the <hi>Syriack</hi> who knows not; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Juſt. Mart. Apol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 94. So <hi>Clem. Alex. Paedag. l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 93, 95. So <hi>Greg. Naz. Orat.</hi> 40.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>N.</hi> ſaith, Juſtifying Faith is ſignified in Baptiſme, then not in the word <hi>Faith</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Text, then Faith muſt be taken
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170413:83"/>in a large ſenſe, and this will rather anſwer to Illumination then repentance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How doth <hi>Reſurrection</hi> anſwer to the <hi>Taſte of the good</hi> word; when as Reſurrection is a terrible word to moſt. The <hi>good word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> rather, the promiſe contains good.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why doth he make one word to anſwer Baptiſm and Impoſition, when they were divided in the Text; and Mr. <hi>N.</hi> hath not yet proved that they went <hi>always</hi> together.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Why may not the <hi>participation of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> have reſpect alſo to ſuch <hi>gifts</hi> as are given now in our days? for do we not obſerve [with trembling] how ſome loſe their gifts, even eminent gifts, profeſſion, and ſo fall away, as never more return? ſhould it be tied up only to <hi>extraordinary gifts</hi> [which I do not believe] yet thoſe were given in Ordination, as Mr. <hi>N.</hi> ſaith, ſo that for that time Impoſition muſt be comprehended.</p>
               <p>His eighth: <hi>Impoſition is made a principle from which it was neceſſary an Apoſtate ſhould fall if finally: but it is not neceſſary that one ſhould be inſtructed touching the office of the Miniſtry: one may be ſaved, and yet be ignorant in the point of Ordination, and one may fall away finally though ignorant in this reſpect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I know not what he means by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates falling from the <hi>principle.</hi> He doth not mean, I ſuppoſe, that a man muſt have firſt thoſe extraordinary gifts, and ſo fall from them, elſe not an Apoſtate; there are too many Apoſtates yet never reached thoſe gifts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. One may be ſaved as well though he doth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170413:83"/>not underſtand the extraordinary gifts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by <hi>Impoſition.</hi> I preſume Mr. <hi>N.</hi> doth not think the Apoſtles conferred the Holy Ghoſt in a <hi>gracious ſaving</hi> way by Impoſition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is one thing for a perſon to be ignorant of Ordination, another to be ignorant of that which Ordination holds out; of what neceſſity the Miniſtry is, Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> and the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> [before mentioned] tell us. So the Scripture. But Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> takes it in a larger ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I think there are few Apoſtates who have been ignorant of the Miniſtry; for thoſe who have been ignorant of this, never came to ſo much as the Text expreſſes; then they cannot fall away from what they never had.</p>
               <p>His ninth: <hi>If we ſhould underſtand the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cirine of the Miniſtry by Impoſition, then we muſt exclude the Adminiſtration of Baptiſme in the principle of Baptiſme, becauſe Baptiſme in this conſideration belongeth unto the Miniſtry, and therefore cannot [unleſs it ſignifie the doctrine of Baptiſme onely] be a diſtinct principle from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. And if we make Baptiſme it ſelfe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the doctrine which it holds forth a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct principle, and the doctrine of Impoſition together with the Adminiſtration of it in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation another diſtinct principle, to what principle ſhall we refer the Lord's Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I miſtake Mr. <hi>N.</hi> in what he would have, I muſt craye pardon; I wiſh he had been more clear, but as I underſtand him, ſo I anſwer. The Lord's Supper being of the ſame nature with Baptiſm; a ſigne to repreſent, a ſeale to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170413:84"/>confirm, an inſtrument to convey, &amp;c. [as ſay our old Catechiſms] well may it be referred to Baptiſme. As for Baptiſme, it being 1. An Ordinance ſo long practiſed before by <hi>John.</hi> 2. The initiating Sacrament. 3. Anſwering all thoſe Baptiſmes the <hi>Hebrews</hi> knew well. 4. At this time greatly eſteemed and practiſed. 5. The ſpirit fore-ſeeing our times wherein that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance would be ſlighted and caſt out, as now it is, no wonder though this be expreſly ſet down, to which the other is fitly referred.</p>
               <p>If the Lord's Supper be referred to Baptiſme [as there is reaſon why it ſhould] and the Miniſtry [which will include Preaching and Diſcipline] be underſtood in Impoſition of hands, then we may have in theſe few heads the ſumme of thoſe Doctrines which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation and a viſible Church in the Ordinances and Officers held forth.</p>
               <p>His tenth: <hi>Interpreters apply this to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi> not all, I named ſome before that are of another opinion. But if we ſhould loſe this Text, yet we have not loſt our cauſe.</p>
               <p>His third Argument I anſwered firſt.</p>
               <p>His fourth is alſo as good as anſwered: this it is, <hi>If we muſt remove Impoſition from converts, from prayers for the ſick, if from</hi> any, <hi>why not</hi> all; <hi>the extraordinary gift ceaſeth in reſpect of Ordination, as well as in reſpect of other Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations.</hi> The ſtrength of the Argument lying upon the <hi>extraordinary gift,</hi> this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before.</p>
               <p>Then he meets with an Objection. <q>It may be a ſacred ſign in Ordination to ſignifie the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170413:84"/>conſecration of a perſon to adminiſter holy things;</q> or if he had pleaſed to have added to ſhew the <hi>Deſignation,</hi> the <hi>Separation,</hi> the <hi>Appointing</hi> of this perſon to his office. As the Congregation ſaw <hi>Joſhua</hi> and knew him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to his office when <hi>Moſes</hi> impoſed hands and charged him.]</p>
               <p>To this he anſwers, 1. <hi>It was not of this uſe in the conſecration of Prieſts and Levites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Why not? he ſhould have told us of what uſe it was, not to confer <hi>extraordinary gifts</hi> I am ſure. Omitting what might be ſaid, let <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſpeak for the reſt of our Divines.

                  <hi>The Lord Chriſt in his Infinite wiſedome and Kingly care conceived it neceſſary for the honour of the place, and execution of the work of a Deacon to appoint choiſe men, &amp; ſolemn Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to</hi> Authorize <hi>them to the work.</hi> If a Deacon be only the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> of the Church, he had need be deſigned and authorized to it; but Mr. <hi>Noyes,</hi> who writeth againſt ruling Elders, giving all their work to the Deacon,

            <p>THe Admiſſion of perſons baptized in their infancy, without due Tryal of their Faith &amp; growth in Chriſt, when grown in years, to a full participation of all Church-Privileges &amp; Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, hath cauſed great confuſion in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of holy things; And therefore, I conceive, the Learned Author of this Elaborate exercitation hath deſerved well of the Churches, by clearing the way of thoſe Admiſſions from Scripture-grounds, and the concurrent Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of many, both Antient and Modern writers; As alſo, by diſcovering and removing thoſe Popiſh additions and pollutions which by ſeveral ſteps and degrees have crept into it. And if what he hath offered in this Eſſay come not up to the Judgement and Practice of the beſt conſtituted Churches; yet this ingenuous and pious overture holds out more than moſt Churches have hitherto attained, and may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the zeal of many to hold out what they have attained, as more commodious for, and perfective of the much-deſired and longed-for reſtauration of the Churches to their privitive purity, both in ſeparating the pretious from the vile, and in uniting the pretious into a more beautiful and beneficial Order among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Theſe conſiderations have confirmed me in giving not only Licenſe to the publiſhing, but thanks to the Publiſher of this diſcourſe of Confirmation.</p>
